The measurements of the surviving sections vary but they are all roughly 26 by 20cm.

F.1b and f.12a each have a surah heading, comprising a gold rectangular cartouche with a roundel extending into the outer margin. The roundel of the first surah heading is bordered with lotus petals and contains three palmettes, similar to those on the leaf in the David Collection; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and in the al-Sabah Collection, Kuwait. The roundel on f.12a is similar in design but consists of one palmette only bordered with a knotted design on a black ground, close to that of the surah heading on the leaf in the Aga Khan Museum, Toronto.

Other distinctive calligraphic characteristics of this Qur'an are the upper terminal lobes on the letter kaf and the thin diagonal trails extending from the top of the letters lam and alif.

Son and brother of two former Ottoman Sultans, he received a strict traditional education.

He was responsible for many innovations in the Ottoman Empire, including the introduction of the first civil code and Imperial Museum in Istanbul. Yet, Sultan Abdulaziz’s interest in modernisation was not always supported by the best financial decisions, and his attempts to streamline the Ottoman navy and railroads were completed to the detriment of the agricultural sector, feeding his growing unpopularity which culminated in the 1876 government coup.\", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"On the vernal equinox of every year, the chief astrologer would present the calendar for the coming year as part of a ceremony.

Throughout the entire manuscript the calligraphy is not written with a pen, as was the norm, but cut out from coloured paper (qit'a) and pasted onto the page. The technical virtuosity that this entails is extraordinary, and the general quality of the manuscript can be seen not only in the découpé calligraphy, but also in the exquisite illumination of the heading panels (as here), the opening double-page frontispiece (see Lentz and Lowry 1989, cat.148, p.268), and the elegant gold-sprinkled borders. In conception alone it is inspiringly ambitious, in execution it is superb. It has been suggested by Anthony Welch that Sultan Ali Mashhadi himself may have been the calligrapher responsible for this masterpiece (Geneva 1985, p.65).\", \"catalogueNote_1\": \"The text is the Diwan of the Timurid prince and ruler of Herat, Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara (r.1470-1506), under whose patronage the arts of the book reached new heights in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. The School of Herat, among whose leading artists were the master Behzad and Sultan Ali Mashhadi, was the apotheosis and swan-song of Timurid art. Marie Lukens-Swietochowski has commented that \\\"It is universally recognised that the reign of Mirza Sultan Husayn Ibn Mansur Ibn Bayqara Ibn Umar Shaykh Ibn Timur, patron par excellence in the tradition of his family, saw the last great flowering of Timurid art in Iran\\\" (Gray et al 1979, p.179). Sultan Husayn was a literary enthusiast, patronising writers and poets such as Ali Shir Nava'i and Jami, and he wrote poetry himself, in Chagatay, using the pen-name Husayni. In this manuscript the ghazals are arranged alphabetically by their rhyme (Roxburgh 2005, p.170).\", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"The manuscript is incomplete and dispersed in a number of collections around the world.

Several of the folios in Western collections appear to have been on the market during the second quarter of the Twentieth century (e.g. the Freer Gallery pages were acquired in 1929, the LACMA pages were previously in the collection of Nasli Heeramaneck, the New York dealer/collector who was active from the 1920s to the middle of the century, and the folio in the Brooklyn Museum was acquired in 1945).\", \"catalogueNote_3\": \"Two leaves, previously in the Stuart Cary Welch collection, were sold in these rooms, 6 April 2011, lots, 41 and 42.

Despite this, every night she would swim across the river, using an earthenware pot to stay afloat, to where her beloved Mahival would be tending to his buffaloes.

The churning of the ocean of milk (samudra manthan) is one of the most well-known episodes of the Bhagavata Purana. Lord Indra, the king of the gods offended the sage Durvasa whilst being in an inebriated condition. The furious Durvasa placed a curse upon Indra and the heavens. As a result, Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, disappeared from the abode of the gods and dissolved into an ocean of milk. Indra and the gods went to seek the help of Vishnu. The gods were then sent to make a truce with the asuras (demons) without whose help the ocean could not be churned. Mount Meru, the mountain home of Brahma was used as a churning stick, Shiva’s snake Vasuki was used as the rope, and Vishnu took on his second avatar as Kurma (the turtle) to prevent the mountain from sinking. The churning led to several treasures emerging from the ocean, including three categories of goddesses, with Lakshmi being the first. All the gods vied for her attention, but she looked to Vishnu for help and chose him as her husband. A painting depicting the churning of the ocean from a Bhagavata Purana series dated to circa 1780-1810 sold recently in these rooms, 27 October 2021, lot 152. \", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"Preparations for the churning of the ocean are depicted in the upper left section of the illustration. However, the main subject of our painting is the wedding celebration of Vishnu and Lakshmi. The couple are seated, with Lakshmi veiled, within an enclosure of tent panels under a canopy. The four-headed god of Creation, Brahma, is the officiating priest for the ceremony. The moon god, Chandra, is depicted to the right of Brahma holding a golden water vessel. Outside the tent enclosure, the other gods have taken possession of some of the other treasures which had emerged from the ocean. Shiva, seated on Nandi the bull, is drinking a cup of poison which had come forth from the great snake Vasuki. Surya, the sun god, is galloping away on the seven-headed horse, Ucchaihshravas. Indra, is seated on the four-tusked elephant, Airavata. Kamadhenu or Surabhi, the cow of plenty, is being led away by one of the gods, while the Parijata tree with its medicinal properties is being carried off by another.\", \"catalogueNote_3\": \"Amrita, the nectar of immortality, was another treasure which emerged from the churning. It was immediately grabbed by the demons. While they were fighting amongst themselves, Vishnu assumed the form of his female avatar, Mohini the enchantress. The demons handed over the pot of nectar to Mohini to divide between themselves and the gods. Mohini did not intend to give any of the demons as that would make them immortal. One of the demons, Svarbhanu, realised this and disguised himself as one of the gods. He was soon discovered by Surya and Chandra, and as soon as he had consumed some of the nectar, he was beheaded by Vishnu’s discus. His body fell to the ground, but his head flew up to the sky and became immortal as Rahu, the demon who swallows the sun and the moon in eclipses. This is the scene depicted in the centre right of the painting. \", \"catalogueNote_4\": \"For another painting attributed to the family workshop of Manaku and Nainsukh dated to circa 1780-1810, depicting an episode from the Rukmani-Harana series, see Lot 65 in the present sale.\"}, \"lotExhibited\": {}, \"lotHash\": \"4c63ddd8b1c8283dd60acb679fe2cf5b5a66c499a3c9212fcc2c9e54ade2559c6d4d8761fe69312d1fca345de207f625b93ec57b84fe3f824df0e502bfede8db\", \"saleHash\": \"068c1070e76430bd6a186d164f5cc2aa32a3389de88e5e8d2c463e2f867a3efe5a3224bd76d0a9cb4b99d32a85b1c0333871a6484ecc0ac2cb22ff4b0737f365\", \"events\": [[{\"label\": \"Moti Chandra, Mumbai\", \"PERSON\": \"Moti Chandra\", \"GPE\": \"Mumbai\"}], [{\"label\": \"Pramod Chandra, Cambridge, Massachusetts\", \"PERSON\": \"Pramod Chandra\", \"GPE\": \"Cambridge\"}], [{\"label\": \"Private collection, USA\", \"GPE\": \"USA\"}], [], [{\"label\": \"Sotheby's London 07 January 2022 lot 63\", \"ORG\": \"Sotheby's\", \"GPE\": \"London\", \"DATE\": \"07 January 2022\", \"CARDINAL\": \"63\"}]]}}\n",

A person can attain salvation (moksha) through performing good deeds or be reborn as lower forms of life due to bad deeds. The ladders in the game symbolise virtues and the snakes are vices. The chart in the present illustration comprises 128 squares, each labelled and numbered in Sankrit with a translation in English below. The game begins at the bottom left corner and finishes at square 124 which is occupied here by a seated figure of the Hindu deity Vishnu. The players ascend the squares through states associated with hell, to moral and spiritual states, finally arriving at the squares associated with salvation and enlightenment. The ladders connect the ‘good’ squares and accelerate the players’ ascent while the snakes connect the ‘bad’ ones reversing their progress.\", \"catalogueNote_1\": \"The present lot is very similar to an illustration of Snakes and Ladders in the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London (RAS 051.001; Head 1991, pp.141-2).

Botany had become a fashionable hobby in the late eighteenth century, partly because of the work of Carl von Linné, a Swedish botanist also known as Carolus Linnaeus (1707-78), who had created a new system of classifying plants. This led to an increase in the production of lavishly illustrated publications in Britain depicting large botanical studies with minimal text.\", \"catalogueNote_8\": \"Four botanists are referred to in the inscriptions – Linnaeus, Buchanan, Aiton and Roxburgh. One of the drawings is inscribed on the reverse in pencil in the hand of Francis Buchanan (1762-1829) who was a surveyor of parts of the East Company’s territories. He was appointed personal physician to Lord Wellesley (Governor General of India, 1798-1805) in Calcutta in 1803 and subsequently put in charge of Wellesley’s private menagerie at Barrackpore, north of Calcutta. William Aiton (1731-93) was the official gardener at Kew Gardens under Sir Joseph Banks. William Roxburgh (1751-1815) took over as the Superintendent of the Sibpur botanical garden in 1793. He is known to have commissioned several Indian artists to produce watercolours of local flora.\", \"catalogueNote_9\": \"These drawings were formerly in the collection of Edward Smith Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby (1775-1851).

But while Guardi and other contemporary artists were more familiar with the subjects, this theme was relatively new to Pietro Longhi; only another canvas by him is known depicting Ottoman characters, it is titled Scena Orientale and it depicts three subjects dressed in Ottoman outfits arguing in front of a European nobleman (published in T.

Pedani, pp.885-948), providing us with a fascinating insight on the internal politics and duties of the bailo.

The report looks also at the state of the military and at commercial relations with other nations, as well as the foreign relations with Pussia, England and Holand (pp.937-8).

It is thus more likely that the Louvre bowl was the product of the rich and sophisticated Abbasid court rather than the earlier Sassanian settlement.

The gilded zoomorphic heads at the extremities of the present lot's handle are clearly identifiable as those belonging to the onager, an Asiatic wild ass, and the protruding ball to the top was probably meant to strengthen the grip for a servant pouring wine. On both ewers, the body, foot and handle were worked separately: the first two parts were hammered on forming stakes, while the handles were probably cast in moulds. Based on similar examples, it may be assumed that they came with a lid, most likely a stopper that dropped into the neck.\", \"catalogueNote_1\": \"Such ewers, distinguishable by a sober yet elegant decoration, were introduced in the Sassanian and Central Asian world in the fifth-sixth centuries and remained prized until the seventh century. Their shape and figural decoration suggest they were intended for domestic purpose. Onagers were animals typically hunted by the Persian aristocracy, and their head was a common decorative feature on silverware. In the case of the following ewer, the absence of a customary elevated border on the foot may indicate a more provincial origin or a slightly later dating (Overlaet 2018).\", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"Another object that closely relates to our ewers, of comparable typology but entirely made of gold, comes from the princely tomb of Malaja Pereshchepina in south-west Ukraine, which contained a rich hoard of gold tableware - Sassanian, Turkish, Avarian and Sogdian in origin. Another is in the Hermitage Museum (inv. no.S-61) and was found in 1821 in a Russian village. Although it is tempting to interpret the presence of Sassanian items in diverse locations as evidence of diplomatic gifts, trade or booty, the spread of this type of objects have more complex implications. The Sassanian empire opened to many neighboring cultures, which it influenced as much as it assimilated. Von Petrikovits demonstrated that the shape of our ewers is particularly close to Roman or Early Byzantine models (von Petrikovits 1969), while their decoration points at Mediterranean later influence. While a similar ewer is represented on the rock relief of Khusrow II at Taq-e Bustan in Iran (see Fukai et al.1984), few exemplars were found directly on Sassanian territory. As such, it is difficult to determine if these ewers derive from import, imitation or direct and indirect influences within the Sassanian and early Islamic world (Overlaet 2018), but they certainly highlight the overwhelming reach of Persian tradition and the Silk Road in the fifth to seventh centuries.\"}, \"lotExhibited\": {}, \"lotLiterature\": {\"literature_0\": \"M. Aimone, The Wyvern Collection: Byzantine and Sasanian Silver, Enamels and Works of Art, London, 2020, cat. no.59.\"}, \"lotHash\": \"9f75275b4094751090c6507b9860fde1012669a779b3b129f774698b1b7736029fc6694fe38c9c50e78a9fcba5b4c7f5bafd9c09e5c954ed56472bbf1656a260\", \"saleHash\": \"068c1070e76430bd6a186d164f5cc2aa32a3389de88e5e8d2c463e2f867a3efe5a3224bd76d0a9cb4b99d32a85b1c0333871a6484ecc0ac2cb22ff4b0737f365\", \"events\": [[{\"label\": \"The Wyvern Collection, London\", \"ORG\": \"The Wyvern Collection\", \"GPE\": \"London\"}], [{\"label\": \"Private collection, Heidelberg, 1980s-2015\", \"GPE\": \"Heidelberg\"}], [], [{\"label\": \"Sotheby's London 07 January 2022 lot 83\", \"ORG\": \"Sotheby's\", \"GPE\": \"London\", \"DATE\": \"07 January 2022\", \"CARDINAL\": \"83\"}]]}}\n",

As it was traversed by the Silk Road, an important mercantile class emerged, and Susan Lerner notes that \\\"so dominant were merchants of Sogdian origin that the Sogdian language became the lingua franca of the Silk Road\\\" (Juliano & Lerner 2001, p.222). This fine parcel-gilt cup may have either belonged to one of these notable trading families or been produced for export. Its shape, construction, and decoration provide a fascinating insight into the convergence of influences found across the Silk Road in the seventh century, with Sogdiana at its centre, serving as a bridge between its Western (Sassanian) neighbours and the Tang Dynasty in China to the East.\", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"Although Sogdian metalwork has been found along the extensive trade routes of Central Asia and China, most of the pieces attributed to Sogdiana were found in Russia’s ‘Taiga’. Thus, the largest collection of Sogdian metalwork is now in The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. The renowned scholar Boris Marshak used technical execution, design and iconography to categorise Sogdian metalwork production and delineate its influences (see Marshak 1971). Notably, he divided Sogdian metalwork into three main regional schools: Western, Central and Eastern schools.\", \"catalogueNote_3\": \"Whereas the present cup displays multiple influences, it most closely relates to the 'Eastern' school. The loop handle most probably derives from an ancient form used as an accoutrement by horse riders, allowing riders to tie such cups to their belts, a remnant of a nomadic tradition. As one notes from Marshak’s report, this loop handle features on all three schools (see for example a cup with rams from Eastern Iran, attributed to the Western School, now in The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, inv. no.S-20; a cup with vegetation, found in Tomyz, from the Central school, also in The State Hermitage Museum; available here: https://eurasiansilver.com/portfolio/1297/; and a wine cup with elephant heads attributed to the Eastern School, probably made in Uzbekistan, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., inv. no.F2012.1).\", \"catalogueNote_4\": \"The vertical gadrooned bands are also a characteristic found in all the above mentioned cups as well as in an example attributed to Eastern Central Asia, now in The State Hermitage Museum, inv. no.S-39.\", \"catalogueNote_5\": \"The design within the central medallion of this cup is both complex and delicate. It is fascinating in its connections to various influences seen across a multitude of media along the silk road and which re-surface on Sogdian metalwork. The incised drawings were created on a 'ring-matted' ground, a technique which deviates the most from the traditional Sassanian design and points to an Easterly, Tang connection. This is a notable feature of both Tang silver and the Central and Eastern schools of Sogdian metalwork, as visible in a wine cup from the early Tang dynasty, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., inv. no.F1930.51 and the Hermitage Tomyz cup previously mentioned. The petalled border which encloses the design also points Eastwards, possibly deriving from Buddhist iconography.\", \"catalogueNote_6\": \"Marshak notes that \\\"common for the Soghdians and the Turks was the representation of animals with features of the heroic ideal.\\\" (Marshak 1971, p.151). The two-winged horses at the centre of this bowl certainly seem to be taking on a heroic ideal. The pairing of facing animals within a medallion are particular to the Sogdian aesthetic and can be seen on the silk robes worn by the Sogdian nobility, see for example the two horses on the sleeve of a Sogdian coat sold in these rooms, 22 April 2015, lot 176.\", \"catalogueNote_7\": \"The vegetal scrolls which emerge like lotuses at the bottom of the bowl are characteristic of the Eastern school of Sogdian metalwork.

One noteworthy example is the Ghaznavid bowl in the al-Sabah Collection, Kuwait (inv. no.LNS 561 M) (Curatola 2010, p.92, no.64), which is decorated with divider-executed linear incisions with recessed fields struck and hammered into the surface, mirroring some of the ornamental aspects of the present piece.\", \"catalogueNote_2\": \"The protruding tubular handle is also paralleled in eastern Iranian wares, such as the ninth/tenth-century bronze incense-burner also in the al-Sabah Collection (ibid, p.70, no.37). The latter, which is broader and heavier in design and execution, can be explained as a functional household utensil compared to the more sophisticated and precious, silver example. Another Khurasan bronze incense burner with long protruding handle is in Terres secrètes de Samarcande: Céramiques du VIIIe au XIIIe siècle (Paris 1992, p.28, no.331).

Forged using the same techniques as silver, brass was seen as the most luxurious metal-based alloy at the time, for it visually resembles gold. As for the inlaying technique, it was already appreciated for the polychromatic effect of gilding and niello, thus occupying an important place in the trade of metals. Thanks to wealthy mineral deposits, Khurasan developed into one of the most flourishing centres for metalwork production in the Islamic World.

The appreciation for Valencian lustreware was such that Venice and Bruges both abolished import taxes on such ceramics, and Spanish lustreware was used at every noble and royal court of Europe (Ray 2000, p.58). Although most such wares are attributed to the workshops of Manises, it is plausible that other centres of production developed in the wider Valencian region, not limiting the production to just one site (Ray 2000, p.58 and Caiger-Smith 1985, p.100).\", \"catalogueNote_1\": \"The shape of this vessel, with a bulbous body and four handles, is rare since most of the wares from the period survive in the form of dishes, bowls and albarelli.

Five comparable vases have survived – four in the British Museum (inv. nos.G597, G599, G602, G596) and another offered in these rooms (14 October 1999, lot 114). They all have the same bulbous body and four handles, and their dimensions vary between 16.5cm (inv. no.G599) and 23cm. (inv. no.G602). The foot is usually spreading and the inner rim is usually decorated with a band of roundels or with a dotted scales motif. Along with chevron and arabesques motifs, they often feature a bands with alafias. The alafia pattern consists of “a calligraphic motif of ‘circular accent’ over an ‘alpha’ on its side; the Arabic word means ‘health and happiness’”(Ray 2000, p.401).

His achievements as part of the revolution to restore the usurped Safavid dynasty led him to the top, and he ruled Persia from 1736-47. His extensive military achievements and vigorous expansion, from the Caucasus mountains to the Indus river, earned him the title of ‘Sword of Persia’ by modern historians (for further information on Nader Shah’s life and conquests, see Axworthy 2006). In fact, a number of swords have been associated with Nader Shah, most notably one within the Museum of Royal Jewels in Tehran (although the blade is in fact inscribed with Fath 'Ali Shah's name), and two others in the Nader Shah Museum in Mashhad. A further sword with nineteenth-century jewelled and enamelled mounts, offered in these rooms, 24 April 2013, lot 204, also bore a dedicatory inscription to Nader along the blade.\", \"catalogueNote_5\": \"However, the present sword is the only complete example to present compelling evidence of its being a personal sword of Nader Shah. Other associations to his name on similar weapons, including those in Iranian museums, are more likely to be honorific. Here, the inscription bearing Nader’s name and titles stands within a circular cartouche and is finely executed, while the watered steel testifies of the blade’s high quality. The maker’s signature includes a Kirman nisba, a region historically known in early manuscripts and travellers accounts as a major fine steel-manufacturing centre. The Kirmani mines and arms workshops were still active under Nader Shah, until they fell into dereliction shortly after his death in the early Qajar period.\", \"catalogueNote_6\": \"The quality of the blade in its patterning and perfect balance, equals that of the finest Persian swordmakers, and as such it stands as the lost representative of a region highly famed for its arms for over five hundred years.

Thanks to this invention Rousseau was awarded the great gold medal by the Sociéte d’Encouragment pour l’Industrie Nationale and in the 1847 General Yearbook of Trade, Industry, Judiciary and Administration the entry to his name reads “author of the gilding process, on any coloured background by half-great fire of kiln of which the large application, the perfect and constant success earned him (several awards)…”.\", \"catalogueNote_1\": \"Gaultier de Claubry praises the “improvements he brought to porcelain decoration”.

The maid has confided in him Madame Weber's scheme to send the police to pick up Constanze, which seems incredible 'because it would amount to prostitution for the whole family, but would still be possible if you know stupid Madame Weber'. Mozart declares that the only solution is for him to marry Constanze the next day &#8211; or the same day if at all possible. He signs off 'in the greatest haste', kissing the Baroness's hands 'a thousand times', and referring to Constanze's guardian, Johann von Thorwart.<br>\\n<br>\\nMozart's marriage to Constanze Weber on 4 August 1782 was one of two concurrent events &#8211; alongside the hugely successful premier of his opera <i>Die Entführung aus der Serail</i> just under three weeks before &#8211; which definitively marked his emancipation from the two figures of authority who had loomed over the early years of his adulthood. These were Archbishop Colloredo, the ruler of Salzburg, and Mozart's own father, Leopold, the deputy <i>Kapellmeister </i>in the Archbishop's court. <br>\\n <br>\\nMozart had arrived in Vienna on 16 March 1781 as a member of the salaried retinue of the Archbishop, for what was supposed to be a short stay. He had other plans however and within six weeks made him self so unbearable that he was literally kicked out of the Archbishop's household by the latter's steward. This left him the greatest composer alive, but with no financial means and nowhere to live. The solutions he sought for both issues were to meet with stiff opposition from his father. For the first, he began seeking musical commissions and putting on independent concerts around Vienna, sometimes in apartments and the ballrooms of restaurants. The second problem he resolved by seeking lodgings with the Weber family, old friends from his brief stay in Mannheim in late 1777 (when he had in fact already fallen in love with their second daughter, the talented soprano Aloysia).<br>\\n<br>\\nThe household, which occupied the second floor of a building named <i>Zum Auge Gottes</i>, consisted of the widowed Maria Cäcilia Weber, and her three unmarried daughters, Josepha, Constanze (then 19 years old &#8211; Mozart was 25) and Sophie. By July, there were already rumours that Mozart was going to marry one of the three daughters, to which he light-heartedly responded in a letter to his anxious father, &#8216;If I had to marry all the girls that I've had a laugh with, I'd have easily 200 wives&#8217;. By September the gossip was becoming sufficiently embarrassing to oblige him to move out to separate lodgings, and on 15 December he broached the prospect of marriage to Constanze in a letter to Leopold (&#8216;Who is the object of my affections? &#8211; Please don&#8217;t be alarmed. &#8211; Surely not one of the Webers? &#8230;&#8217;); a week later he admitted that he had already given a written promise that he would marry Constanze within three years to her guardian, Johann von Thorwart, an influential figure in Viennese theatre . <br>\\n <br>\\nThere were some difficulties in the ensuing courtship &#8211; not least because of Leopold&#8217;s reluctance to give his consent and doubts over Mozart&#8217;s financial resources. But the young couple evidently received encouragement from the recipient of the present letter, Baroness von Waldstätten, who invited Constanze to stay at her house in Leopoldstadt outside Vienna on several occasions (including in April 1782 when Mozart flew into rage after a parlour game involving a male guest measuring Constanze's calves). By late July, Mozart had made it clear to his father that he and Constanze were already in a sexual relationship, and she had evidently moved out of her mother's house, although it is not clear from the present letter whether she was staying, as previously, with the Baroness, or in fact already living with Mozart in his new apartment in Vienna.<br>\\n<br>\\nWhether driven to a decision by his future mother-in-law or not, Mozart wrote to Leopold on 27 July begging his father to grant his long-delayed consent to their marriage. He and Constanze took communion together on 2 August, signed a marriage contract on the 3rd, and on the 4th were married at St Stephen&#8217;s Cathedral, with the baroness throwing a &#8216;princely&#8217; wedding supper; Leopold&#8217;s letter granting his reluctant permission arrived on the following day. Echoing the name of his opera (which translates as <i>The Abduction from the Seraglio</i>) and of the Webers' house, <i>Zum Auge Gottes</i>, Mozart cheerfully referred to the successful conclusion of events as 'die Entführung aus dem Auge Gottes'. <br>\\n <br>\\nConstanze Mozart (1762-1842) was one of a highly musical family, and like her sisters trained as a singer: in a letter to his sister Nannerl in April 1782, Mozart attributes to Constanze his newfound interest in counterpoint, and she was to sing the 'Et incarnatus est' at the first performance of his Great Mass in C minor (K.427) during a visit to Salzburg in October 1783 (when she met Leopold and Nannerl for the first time). In their nine years of married life, Mozart and Constanze were to have six children, though only two survived infancy. Her husband's death in 1791 left her in difficulties, but after securing a pension from the Emperor and arranging a campaign of publication of Mozart&#8217;s works, Constanze went on to achieve financial security, and she was to leave the considerable sum of 30,000 florins at her death in 1842. She collaborated on two of the earliest biographies of Mozart, by Franz Xaver Niemetschek (1798) and by her second husband Georg Nikolaus von Nissen (1829).<br>\\n<br>\\nThe connections between Mozart and the broader Weber family were numerous: he wrote arias for Aloysia both in Mannheim and in Vienna where she established a successful singing career from 1779. Aloysia was to perform the part of Donna Anna in the Viennese premiere of <i>Don Giovanni </i>in 1788, and the eldest sister, Josepha, was the Queen of the Night in the premiere of <i>The Magic Flute. </i>Meanwhile, Aloysia&#8217;s husband, the actor and amateur artist Joseph Lange, produced one of the best-known portraits of Mozart at around the time of his marriage. In spite of his rudeness about Cäcilia Weber in the present letter, Mozart&#8217;s relationship with his mother-in-law was ultimately very affectionate: Sophie Weber later remembered him bringing her coffee and sugar for her afternoon drink.<br>\\n<br>\\nAutograph letters by Mozart are rare at auction: Rare Book Hub records only one sale in the last ten years (Christie's New York, 2017).

on the farcical circumstances preceding his marriage to Constanze Weber.\", \"details_32\": \"Mozart has taken delivery of some music from the maidservant of Constanze's mother, who has used this as a pretext for getting a written receipt (possibly with the intention of demonstrating that Mozart and Constanze are already cohabiting).\", \"details_33\": \"The maid has confided in him Madame Weber's scheme to send the police to pick up Constanze, which seems incredible 'because it would amount to prostitution for the whole family, but would still be possible if you know stupid Madame Weber'.\", \"details_34\": \"Mozart declares that the only solution is for him to marry Constanze the next day – or the same day if at all possible.\", \"details_35\": \"He signs off 'in the greatest haste', kissing the Baroness's hands 'a thousand times', and referring to Constanze's guardian, Johann von Thorwart.\", \"details_36\": \"Mozart's marriage to Constanze Weber on 4 August 1782 was one of two concurrent events – alongside the hugely successful premier of his opera Die Entführung aus der Serail just under three weeks before – which definitively marked his emancipation from the two figures of authority who had loomed over the early years of his adulthood.\", \"details_37\": \"These were Archbishop Colloredo, the ruler of Salzburg, and Mozart's own father, Leopold, the deputy Kapellmeister in the Archbishop's court.\", \"details_38\": \"Mozart had arrived in Vienna on 16 March 1781 as a member of the salaried retinue of the Archbishop, for what was supposed to be a short stay.\", \"details_39\": \"He had other plans however and within six weeks made him self so unbearable that he was literally kicked out of the Archbishop's household by the latter's steward.\", \"details_40\": \"This left him the greatest composer alive, but with no financial means and nowhere to live.\", \"details_41\": \"The solutions he sought for both issues were to meet with stiff opposition from his father.\", \"details_42\": \"For the first, he began seeking musical commissions and putting on independent concerts around Vienna, sometimes in apartments and the ballrooms of restaurants.\", \"details_43\": \"The second problem he resolved by seeking lodgings with the Weber family, old friends from his brief stay in Mannheim in late 1777 (when he had in fact already fallen in love with their second daughter, the talented soprano Aloysia).\", \"details_44\": \"The household, which occupied the second floor of a building named Zum Auge Gottes, consisted of the widowed Maria Cäcilia Weber, and her three unmarried daughters, Josepha, Constanze (then 19 years old – Mozart was 25) and Sophie.\", \"details_45\": \"By July, there were already rumours that Mozart was going to marry one of the three daughters, to which he light-heartedly responded in a letter to his anxious father, ‘If I had to marry all the girls that I've had a laugh with, I'd have easily 200 wives’.\", \"details_46\": \"By September the gossip was becoming sufficiently embarrassing to oblige him to move out to separate lodgings, and on 15 December he broached the prospect of marriage to Constanze in a letter to Leopold (‘Who is the object of my affections?\", \"details_47\": \"– Please don’t be alarmed.\", \"details_48\": \"– Surely not one of the Webers? …’)\", \"details_49\": \"a week later he admitted that he had already given a written promise that he would marry Constanze within three years to her guardian, Johann von Thorwart, an influential figure in Viennese theatre .\", \"details_50\": \"There were some difficulties in the ensuing courtship – not least because of Leopold’s reluctance to give his consent and doubts over Mozart’s financial resources.\", \"details_51\": \"But the young couple evidently received encouragement from the recipient of the present letter, Baroness von Waldstätten, who invited Constanze to stay at her house in Leopoldstadt outside Vienna on several occasions (including in April 1782 when Mozart flew into rage after a parlour game involving a male guest measuring Constanze's calves).\", \"details_52\": \"By late July, Mozart had made it clear to his father that he and Constanze were already in a sexual relationship, and she had evidently moved out of her mother's house, although it is not clear from the present letter whether she was staying, as previously, with the Baroness, or in fact already living with Mozart in his new apartment in Vienna.\", \"details_53\": \"Whether driven to a decision by his future mother-in-law or not, Mozart wrote to Leopold on 27 July begging his father to grant his long-delayed consent to their marriage.\", \"details_54\": \"He and Constanze took communion together on 2 August, signed a marriage contract on the 3rd, and on the 4th were married at St Stephen’s Cathedral, with the baroness throwing a ‘princely’ wedding supper\", \"details_55\": \"Leopold’s letter granting his reluctant permission arrived on the following day.\", \"details_56\": \"Echoing the name of his opera (which translates as The Abduction from the Seraglio) and of the Webers' house, Zum Auge Gottes, Mozart cheerfully referred to the successful conclusion of events as 'die Entführung aus dem Auge Gottes'.\", \"details_57\": \"Constanze Mozart (1762-1842) was one of a highly musical family, and like her sisters trained as a singer: in a letter to his sister Nannerl in April 1782, Mozart attributes to Constanze his newfound interest in counterpoint, and she was to sing the 'Et incarnatus est' at the first performance of his Great Mass in C minor (K.427) during a visit to Salzburg in October 1783 (when she met Leopold and Nannerl for the first time).\", \"details_58\": \"In their nine years of married life, Mozart and Constanze were to have six children, though only two survived infancy.\", \"details_59\": \"Her husband's death in 1791 left her in difficulties, but after securing a pension from the Emperor and arranging a campaign of publication of Mozart’s works, Constanze went on to achieve financial security, and she was to leave the considerable sum of 30,000 florins at her death in 1842.\", \"details_60\": \"She collaborated on two of the earliest biographies of Mozart, by Franz Xaver Niemetschek (1798) and by her second husband Georg Nikolaus von Nissen (1829).\", \"details_61\": \"The connections between Mozart and the broader Weber family were numerous: he wrote arias for Aloysia both in Mannheim and in Vienna where she established a successful singing career from 1779.\", \"details_62\": \"Aloysia was to perform the part of Donna Anna in the Viennese premiere of Don Giovanni in 1788, and the eldest sister, Josepha, was the Queen of the Night in the premiere of The Magic Flute.\", \"details_63\": \"Meanwhile, Aloysia’s husband, the actor and amateur artist Joseph Lange, produced one of the best-known portraits of Mozart at around the time of his marriage.\", \"details_64\": \"In spite of his rudeness about Cäcilia Weber in the present letter, Mozart’s relationship with his mother-in-law was ultimately very affectionate:\", \"details_65\":

The 12 engravings depict the victories of the Qing troops against local rebels in eleven battle scenes, with the final scene showing the imperial reception of the victorious army and its commander, the military officer Fukang'an (d. 1796), a Manchu of the Bordered Yellow Banner.<br>\\n <br>\\nIn 1786, Taiwan's Heaven and Earth Society, comprising Ming loyalists, rose up in revolt under their self-proclaimed king, Lin Shuang-wen.

Eventually the Qing court sent General Fukang'an &#8211; the Emperor&#8217;s own son &#8211; with 20,000 reinforcements, which, being better equipped and more disciplined, quickly suppressed the rebels, capturing the ringleader Lin Shuang-wen.<br>\\n <br>\\nImpressed by the wall paintings and the engravings he had commissioned from the Jesuits at the imperial court to commemorate his central Asian victories (see previous lot), Emperor Qianlong desired similar commemorative prints to be made of his other military campaigns.

The Qing court, sensitive to the stability of Tibet, sent a force to monitor the situation, but did not intervene because the Nepalese and Tibetans reached an accord with the Treaty of Kerung, which included Nepal withdrawing from conquered territory and Tibet paying tribute. However, the Tibetans refused to pay their tribute, and the war continued in 1791 with a further Nepalese invasion. <br>\\n <br>\\nThis time, General Fukang'an was dispatched from Beijing with 10,000 soldiers. In a military masterstroke, he decided to enter Tibet from Xining in the north, thus shortening the march, but crossing high mountain passes in deep snow and cold in the depths of winter. Nonetheless, Fukang'an&#8217;s force reached Lhasa within sixty days, traversing nearly two thousand kilometres. By the summer of 1792 Fukang'an had won a decisive series of encounters against the Gurkha armies, but then he endured a considerable setback when his army tried to cross a monsoon-flooded Betrawati. In September, the Nepalese successfully counterattacked, and eventually a military stalemate set in, partly because the Nepalese were facing incursions from other neighbouring states on other fronts. Eventually a peace treaty was signed, the terms of which were favourable to the Qing as they retained control of Tibet, and although Nepal retained its autonomy, they were forced to pay tribute to the Qing dynasty every five years.<br>\\n <br>\\nContinuing the tradition of commemorating his military campaigns, Emperor Qianlong once again commissioned similar prints to those made of his other military campaigns. Like the Taiwan prints (see previous lot), the scenes in the present lot were designed by Jia Quan and Li Ming, who were used to working in the Jesuit tradition. So although the production is wholly Chinese in origin and execution, western engraving techniques were employed.<br>\\n <br>\\nThe plates depict seven military victories and the ceremony concluding hostilities.

the burgeoning interest in gardening and botany.\", \"lot_essay_5\": \"Flowers became an integral part of interior decoration in the homes of the wealthy elite and in response to this trend the Sèvres factory began to create vases in an ever increasing number of shapes.\", \"lot_essay_6\": \"Most of the new forms, including these bulb-pots, were designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis, père (c.

artist, either identified by his painter’s mark of a ‘K’ or attributed to him on stylistic grounds, and executed between 1760 and 1763.3 Of this group, five pieces were delivered to Louis XV and fifteen to Madame de Pompadour, indicating their significance in the Sèvres decorative repertoire and their appeal to the French Court and the uppermost echelons of society.\", \"lot_essay_15\": \"Dodin was one of the most talented and revered painters at the Vincennes factory and then Sèvres, his career spanning forty-nine years from 1754 until 1803.\", \"lot_essay_16\": \"His technique was

palette, shading and richness of detail in his compositions.\", \"lot_essay_18\": \"His diverse subjects were inspired by a broad range of sources and he was probably one of the only painters to work directly from original paintings rather than engravings.4\", \"lot_essay_19\": \"'Chinoiserie' began to appear in European art and decoration in the mid-to-late 17th century but gained popularity in the 18th century, inspired by fanciful descriptions of China or from goods imported to Europe since the Middle Ages.\", \"lot_essay_20\": \"In the 1760s, Dodin appears to have been the only artist to specialise in this distinctive chinoiserie style at Sèvres, as seen on this small group of objects depicting scenes of courtly leisure and distinguished by a bright famille rose-type palette and outlining of the figures in black, which recollect Chinese woodblock prints, porcelains and Canton enamels.\", \"lot_essay_21\": \"However, on some pieces in this group, and indeed on one of our bulb-pots, a more direct source can be identified, where Dodin has turned to French adaptations of these Chinese sources, in the form of engravings.\", \"lot_essay_22\": \"The scene on one of our bulb-pots, with a figure of a child tugging at his mother’s robes, was adapted from an etching by Gabriel Huquier, l’aîné (1695-1772), after François Boucher (1703-70), from a series entitled Scènes de la vie Chinoise.\", \"lot_essay_23\": \"Juliet Carey argues that while Boucher ‘refined and recombined elements from Western prints into fashionably updated chinoiseries’, he also ‘assimilated authentic Chinese imagery for French markets’.5\", \"lot_essay_24\": \"This is evident on our bulb-pot where the woman and child comes from – via Huquier’s etching after Boucher – a wood block print in a Chinese account of silk and rice production, the Yuzhi genzhi tu (originally published in Beijing in 1696), which was widely admired in the West.\", \"lot_essay_25\": \"With his use of black outlines and a distinctive, bold palette, Dodin appears to emphasise the Chinese origins of the scene, while slightly adapting the scene from the print source.\", \"lot_essay_26\": \"Also of note are the boldly painted chinoiserie flowers, known as 'fleurs d’Indes', on three sides of each bulb-pot, whose loose arrangements, angular stems and large blooms are reminiscent of flower decoration on oriental porcelains and may have been executed by Louis-Jean Thévenet.6\", \"lot_essay_27\": \"The garniture\", \"lot_essay_28\": \"These piédestaux were often included in garnitures, which were made up of several vase shapes of varying sizes.\", \"lot_essay_29\": \"In this instance, our vases are identical in date (bearing date letter ‘K’ for 1763), in painter (bearing painter’s mark ‘K’ for

decoration, sold for 120 livres as part of a delivery to Lemaitre, probably a dealer, together with a pair of caisses carré (for 96 livres each) and a vase hollandois (for 156 livres), to form a six-vase garniture.\", \"lot_essay_32\": \"However, it is likely that bulb-pots of this form were not always clearly specified in the factory records and fell into the category of 'vases’ or ‘pieces d’ornements', delivered in larger quantity in 1763 with variable price tags to the King and also to the marchands-merciers and especially Simon-Philippe Poirier.\", \"lot_essay_33\": \"Through his in-depth knowledge of the price structure employed at Sèvres, David Peters has helped confirm that a sale to Poirier of just such a group, listed in the Sales Registers under dealer returns between

enriching the gilt ribbons surrounding the painted scenes.\", \"lot_essay_45\": \"But this level of sameness will not have been arbitrary, particularly given the factory’s tradition of using subtle differences in gilding patterns to help differentiate between vases and services that at first glance appear identical.\", \"lot_essay_46\": \"Rather, it points strongly in favour of the six vases
