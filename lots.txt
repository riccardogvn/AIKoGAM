to begin with, i would never have thought those muses worth so much money and all the muses would have agreed. but they would at least have been appropriate to my library and in keeping with my studies: where on earth do i put the maenads? they are pretty little figures, of course: i know them well and have often seen them. had i fancied them, i would have specifically commissioned you to buy statues that were known to me. for i often buy the sort of sculptures that will embellish a place in my palastra and give it the appearance of a study centre ( gymnasium ). but a statue of mars? what do i, the advocate of peace, want with that? i am glad you didn't get one of saturn too, for i would suspect these two of running me into debt. i would rather a mercury of some sort, for then i might have had better luck in my business with avianius ..." the end of the roman empire and the advent of christianity marked a dwindling in the interest of what was seen as pagan art and, up until the end of the middle ages, much ancient art was destroyed or disappeared. two further revivals of classical art followed, the first in the renaissance, the second in the 18th century. widespread building programmes undertaken in rome and other italian cities in the 15th century brought people into contact with classical sculpture, mainly roman copies of greek art (inspiring artists such as michelangelo to experiment with the human form in sculpture). the revival of interest in classical antiquity driven by the humanist movement, coupled with the opportunity for travel and also chance discoveries, resulted in a new era of collecting. the mania for all things classical reached new heights in the 18th century as a result of the excavations at herculaneum (1738) and pompeii (1740). easier travel around the mediterranean facilitated the fashion for the grand tour so popular with the english. the collections formed by titled and untitled gentlemen installed in galleries and grand london houses or country estates such as wilton house, holkham hall and lansdowne house were prestigious emblems of wealth, power and good taste, and came to form the basis of great national collections. as new areas and civilizations of the ancient world have come to be revealed, so increasing interest has been taken in them. collecting and studying the artefacts of past cultures has long been seen as a way to understand them better, and to interpret and understand their heritage is to inform ourselves and understand our own world the more. it is this tradition that lies behind the formation of the stanford place collection. a passion for ancient civilizations and an appreciation of the timeless beauty of the art created by its master artists and craftsmen has inspired the acquisition of works from the ancient classical world, as well as from egypt and the ancient near east. the collection has been the focus of study and inspired the acquisition of the specialised library at stanford place. museum curators and scholars alike have been welcomed at stanford place to examine the objects and use the library, and several antiquities in the collection have been loaned to museums, including the 'langlotz' head (lot 28) on loan to the michael c. carlos museum from 2004 to 2006, the greek bronze 'apollo' head (lot 29), exhibited at the antikenmuseum basel, 1996-2006, the phrygian silver figure (lot 60) on loan to the metropolitan museum of art, 1999-2006, and the proto-bactrian copper alloy heroic figure (lot 62) on loan to the metropolitan museum of art, 1999-2001. many collectors over the past century have reflected that they are not so much owners as caretakers - custodians of the cherished artefacts of past civilizations for a limited and privileged period. it is hoped that the dispersal of the stanford place collection will continue to inspire new generations of collectors and inform us about our ancestors and world heritage. we are grateful to pearson bruce photography for photographs of lots 4-7, 12, 14, 17-18, 22-23, 26-27, 30-31, 34-36, 39, 41-47, 49-50, 59, 61, 68, 70 and front cover. copyright for these images is with the trustees of the stanford place collection. the stanford place collection of antiquities: sold by order of the trustees; christie's 26 april 2006 lot 1.

"quand [jacques groppi] fut maître en son métier lui vint le désir de voyager pour perfectionner, apprendre d'autres méthodes de travail, apprendre, toujours apprendre, ce qu'il fit toute sa vie." "when he finished his apprenticeship, [jacques groppi] decided to travel to perfect his skills, learn new work methods, learn, always learn, which he did his whole life." georgette groppi, 1990 "que fais-tu ici ? viens avec moi en egypte. c'est un pays neuf qui après l'ouverture du canal de suez, promet un avenir florissant. " "what are you doing here ? come to egypt with me. this is a new country which, after the opening of the suez canal will offer a flourishing future." georgette groppi, 1990 the business becomes successful and in the early years of the 20th century, the couple sell it and then set up an export company: eggs to england, vegetables and quails to europe. jacques intends to go back to switzerland at some point, but loses everything in miscalculated land investment. he is forced to start again so he decides to go to cairo where he founds maison groppi on el manakh street. after studying in neuchâtel in switzerland, and in england, their son achille joins the family business. the dynamic young man helps develop the pâtisserie-confiserie. during the first world war, egypt becomes a strategic military centre, and maison groppi the social epicentre for visiting soldiers and sailors, who cannot get enough of the coffee, cakes and other treats on offer. at the end of the war, jacques returns to switzerland and achille takes over the business. he then builds the premises on midan soliman pacha, with office, laboratory, shop and restaurant all in the art nouveau style of the 1920s. french artists from the ecole des beaux-arts in paris come to decorate the rotonde with lapis-lazuli and golden floral mosaics, alabaster and iron lamps, and italian marble. the continued success of maison groppi is due to two intrinsic values: utmost standard of quality, and treating every order with the same care; from a simple birthday cake, to a one hundred-seat moonlit banquet at the pyramids, to the official opening of the aswan dam for a thousand people. achille is a perfectionist; he wants only the best ingredients in order to provide the best quality. he travels widely in order to bring back the latest technology to cairo: la crème chantilly from france, and ice-cream from the united states of america. he has a continuous desire for knowledge, and a drive to always do better. the best, only the best. "les clients qui partaient en vacances en europe ne manquaient pas à leur retour de raconter à mon père [jacques groppi] qu'ils n'avaient pas vu d'aussi belles pâtisseries, tea rooms, ni à paris, ni en italie, ni gôuter d'aussi bons produits qu'au caire chez groppi." "coming back from their european holidays, clients would tell my father [jacques groppi] that they never saw such beautiful pastries and tea rooms, neither in paris nor in italy, neither did they taste anything better than in cairo at groppi's." georgette groppi, 1990 in 1925, he founds l'industrie du froid, firstly to provide the elite cairenes with much needed ice, and then to produce the famous groppi ice cream, which continues to be popular up until the 1980s. during the second world war, again in order to provide the best for his customers, he builds two farms: a dairy farm, north of cairo in shebine el kanater with 500 gamoussa (egyptian water buffaloes) and 500 cows, and another on the island of geziret el dahab, south of cairo, where he grows fruit, vegetables, and herbs. after achille's unexpected death in 1949, two members of the family take over the business until the early 1980s, thereby making maison groppi a continuous family-owned business for nearly 100 years. "[groppi] devint bientôt le point de rencontre de tous les avocats, [...] des médecins, des banquiers qui venaient à midi. [...] l'après-midi, c'était au tour des dames pour l'heure du thé." "[groppi] soon became the meeting venue for lawyers, [...] doctors, bankers during lunch. [...] in the afternoon, the ladies would come for tea." georgette groppi, 1990 achille travels throughout egypt indulging his passion for wildlife. one can imagine him sailing on the nile observing the river bank scenes: gamoussa bathing, river birds on their backs, waiting for sunset, fishermen hauling in their nets, all surrounded by luxuriant vegetation. looking for a testament of egypt's natural beauty, achille becomes infatuated with ancient glass. he forms one of the three best collections of egyptian glass at this time, alongside that of king farouk and levy benzion. he finds in ancient mosaic glass egypt's finest and most complex works of art, the vibrant colours fused together to create a precise pattern, probably not dissimilar to groppi's best confiserie creations. "cela ne m'étonne pas qu'on consomme autant de glace [aux u.s.a.]. tout est servi sur de la glace, on met des gros morceaux de glace carrés dans les verres et on vous sert continuellement de l'eau...le vin se servait chambré..." "it does not surprise me that so much ice is used [in the u.s.a.]. everything is served on ice; they put big square ice cubes in glasses and continually pour water...wine was served at room temperature..." achille groppi, 1928 "le cosmopolitan museum of art (metropolitan à présent) [a] la meilleure collection que j'ai vu hors du caire [y compris[ paris et londres. [mais il y a peu de verres], jusqu'à maintenant la collection achille groppi est unique peut-être?" "the cosmopolitan museum of art (now metropolitan) holds the best collection outside of cairo, including paris and london. [not many glass pieces though], could the achille groppi collection be unique up until now?" achille groppi, 1928 the collection was first offered at christie's, london, in december 1992, july 1993, and december 1993 under the title per neb , parts i-iii. this catalogue presents part iv of this fabulous ensemble, a reflection of achille groppi's unerring eye for beauty and perfection. laetitia delaloye (the great-great-granddaughter of jacques groppi); christie's 26 april 2012 lot 1.

property from the estate of william kelly simpson “hardly a member of the lay public interested in egypt has not read and enjoyed [william kelly simpson’s] literature of ancient egypt, an anthology of stories, instructions, and poetry or learned from his ancient near east: a history ” writes boston museum of fine arts curator rita freed of the late egyptologist, william kelly simpson (1928-2017). freed encompasses the sentiment that many who are enamored with ancient egypt and the near east feel, that it is nearly impossible to delve into these ancient cultures without encountering simpson’s scholarship. but to simply think of william kelly simpson as a scholar is erroneous: his connections to egyptology include the multifaceted titles of archaeologist, philologist, professor, curator and collector. thus, simpson held an unparalleled position within the field and is regarded as one of its most revered authorities. william kelly simpson was born in manhattan in 1928. he attended manhattan’s buckley school, phillips academy in andover, massachusetts and yale university from where he graduated in 1947 with a degree in english, and obtained his master’s degree in philosophy in 1948. that same year, he made his initial foray into egyptology, when curators w.c. hayes and ambrose lansing of the metropolitan museum of art hired the graduate as a curatorial assistant in the department of egyptian art. imbued with an insatiable curiosity and precocious mind, professor simpson penned his first egyptological article—an exploration of a fourth dynasty portrait head—at just twenty-one years old. that piece, published in the bulletin of the metropolitan museum of art , heralded a remarkable scholarly output, with more than 130 articles and twenty books written throughout his lifetime. professor simpson’s position within the met’s department of egyptian art forever changed the trajectory of his life, and, indeed, the wider field of egyptology. it was during his time at the met that professor simpson participated in his first archaeological expedition—an excavation in iraq sponsored by the british school of archaeology—and decided to pursue graduate work in egyptology. in the early 1950s, the young scholar commuted between his work in new york and his studies at yale, all while serving in the 101st armed calvary of the new york national guard. in june 1953, professor simpson married a granddaughter of john d. rockefeller, jr. professor simpson studied for his doctorate under noted egyptologist ludlow bull, and wrote his dissertation on the excavation of the pyramid of amenemhat i. it was not until obtaining his ph.d. from yale in 1954, however, that professor simpson made his first trek to egypt, after being awarded a prestigious fulbright research fellowship. professor simpson led excavation teams at the bent pyramid at dahshur and at mitrahineh for two years. upon returning to the united states, he was immediately offered a fellowship at harvard’s center for middle eastern studies, and in 1958 was appointed assistant professor of near eastern languages and literature at yale. during professor simpson’s forty-six years in academia, he rose to associate professor, professor, and chair of yale’s department of near eastern languages and literature; was awarded a guggenheim fellowship in the humanities; and positioned yale as one of the foremost centers for egyptology. among his many archaeological projects in egypt were the famed pennsylvania-yale expeditions recording new kingdom tombs and meroitic cemeteries, the 1960s unesco campaign to rescue nubian monuments threatened by the construction of the aswan dam, and excavations at the giza pyramids and sites in nubia. “[professor simpson] served the monuments of egypt…with unstinting passion,” noted fellow scholar hussein bassir. “he served as a major channel between egypt and the us,” bassir added, “to the benefit of the two nations and the archaeological and cultural ties between the two countries.” i had the distinct pleasure of knowing kelly for 25 years, as i met him soon after joining christie’s in 1992. of course i was well aware of his achievements, having lived in cambridge, massachusetts the decade prior, where everyone in the field of ancient art knew of his contributions to egyptology, especially in terms of his tenure at the mfa, boston. he was a frequent visitor to the pre-sale exhibitions at christie’s and always generous with his opinions on the works of art on offer, and even an occasional buyer. more enjoyable still were the visits made to his homes in new york city and westchester county together with my christie’s colleagues when we were asked to appraise the collection. a delicious lunch was always served, with kelly at the head of the table, driving the lively conversations with stories about the works in his collection or of his fascinating experiences in egypt. i am sure i echo the sentiments of all who knew him that his passing creates an enormous void in the field of egyptology. i can only hope that we can in some small way convey his importance to collectors and connoisseurs with our presentation of his private collection in our october antiquities sale. --g. max bernheimer, international head of antiquities at christie’s;

"it speaks to me!", he would delightedly exclaim as he added each creature to his zoo. with an eye honed on the most exquisite details of the finest greek coins, leo had a knack for choosing works of beautiful craftsmanship and superb quality. the adjectives fitting some of leo's animals - the frisky horses, skittish birds, masterful lions, dashing antelopes - all applied to leo himself. each animal spoke to leo and, since his demise in january 2001, they speak for him, each in its own quiet way, with the look in its eye and the grace of its figure. arielle p. kozloffcleveland, ohio select bibliography a. p. kozloff (ed.), animals in ancient art from the leo mildenberg collection, part i, the cleveland museum of art, cleveland, 1981. a. p. kozloff, perry grin's travels , the cleveland museum of art, cleveland, 1981 (a children's story book). u. gehrig (ed.), tierbilder aus vier jahrtausenden, antiken der sammlung mildenberg , mainz am rhein, 1983. a. p. kozloff, d. g. mitten and m. sguaitamatti, more animals in ancient art from the leo mildenberg collection , part ii, mainz am rhein, 1986. a. s. walker (ed.), animals in ancient art from the leo mildenberg collection , part iii, mainz am rhein, 1996. g. zahlhaas, aus noahs arche, tierbilder der sammlung mildenberg aus fünf jahrtausenden , part iv, mainz am rhein, 1996. p. e. mottahedeh (ed.), out of noah's ark, animals in ancient art from the leo mildenberg collection , bible lands museum, jerusalem, 1997. j. biers (ed.), a peaceable kingdom, animals in ancient art from the leo mildenberg collection , part vi, mainz am rhein, 2004. christie's london, a peaceable kingdom: the leo mildenberg collection of ancient animals , 26-27 october 2004, lots 1-419; and christie's new york, antiquities , 10 december 2004, lots 1-41, 301-338. the leo mildenberg memorial numismatic lecture these lectures are held annually to commemorate dr. mildenberg's long connection with harvard university, to which he came nearly every year to deliver a lecture on some major numismatic subject that he was researching. this year's lecture, the third, will take place on friday, 15 april 2005, in the sackler museum auditorium at 6.00 pm. the lecture will be on the silver shekels of tyre, given by brooks emmons levy, curator emerita of the numismatic collections in the princeton university library. the public is warmly invited to attend. the leo mildenberg collection of ancient animals (lots 201-265) near eastern; christie's 20 april 2005 lot 201.

provenance: plesch collection.; the plesch collection of ancient glass peter and traudi plesch met in 1959 in staffordshire and married four years later. both were refugees from nazi persecution, peter having left germany in 1933 and traudi austria in 1938. coming from a family of art collectors, peter plesch had already formed a fine collection of european glass when they met, as well as chinese and japanese art. one influence had been his maternal great uncle, fritz von gans, who had left his antiquities' collection to the royal prussian museum, berlin. however, on their honeymoon in israel, traudi fell for the lure of ancient glass which inspired a new joint adventure, the one criterion for a purchase being that she and peter should both want the object, although not necessarily with the same passion. the frequent invitations given to peter plesch to lecture worldwide on cationic polymerisation, his specialism at keele university, afforded the couple the opportunity of scouring antique shops in many countries for antique glass and other works of art. thus their collection of ancient glass was formed slowly and wisely over four decades, reflecting their desire to have beautiful, but also academically meaningful pieces. they were invited to lend some of their major glass pieces to the glass circle's 25th and 50th anniversary exhibitions. traudi plesch's interest in ancient glass and her lectures thereon were a small part of her major life's work, which was volunteering locally and spearheading fundraising, whether for the douglas macmillan hospice, the police dependants trust, the british heart foundation or the nspcc as local president, amongst her many other charities. her work was recognised in 1988 with an m.b.e. for "fundraising for charities" and, in 2000, with an o.b.e. for "services to the county of staffordshire". a local newspaper referred to her as the "robin hood of the westlands", the area of newcastle-under-lyme where they lived. one of their most rewarding trips was returning in 2002 to the villa lemm, at gatow on the havel outside berlin, the former holiday home of peter's parents, janos and melanie plesch. it was here that a small flat in the gardener's cottage had been put at the disposal of albert einstein, professor janos plesch's patient and friend. there einstein was out of reach of unwelcome visitors and could sail his beloved boat. an exhibition held in 2004 at the jewish museum in berlin on the professional jewish bourgeoisie of circa 1830-1933 featured a painting of the plesch family in 1928 by the german post-impressionist painter, max slevogt. it also included documents, photographs, clothing and other objects from the plesch household. theirs has been a long and enduring partnership and it is only now that traudi and peter plesch have left their beloved home for a smaller residence, that they are parting with their glass collection, in the hope that other collectors will have the pleasure of owning some of these rare and exquisite artefacts. how i started to collect glass by traudi plesch when i married peter, my second husband, in 1963, i obviously wanted to share in his activities and enthusiasms. since i had no scientific background of any kind, i had no hope or any wish to participate in the chemistry part of his life, but his appetite for collecting many different kinds of artistic artefacts did appeal to me. during my childhood in vienna, i visited many museums and had been surrounded by viennese pictures and furnishings of the 19th and 20th century, so that i had a grounding and liking for artistic surroundings. my great love for ancient mediterranean glass was started by a few pieces in peter's collection and through visits to israel, but i was really made aware of it through a rare chance. when, on one of peter's american consulting journeys, we landed in new york, an arts-aware friend there had procured for us the catalogue of an antiquities' sale, the distribution of which had been delayed by a postal strike. thus at the sale only a very few dealers and collectors were present in the room, so that they and i were in the right place at the right time, which is what every collector dreams of. peter was not with me but, nonetheless, i was able to make some outstanding purchases of egyptian and roman glass at very low cost to my delight and the great annoyance of those whose catalogues had arrived too late . a cataloguing system for the perplexed collector by peter plesch i want to offer help to perplexed collectors by explaining the cataloguing system which i devised in the late 1950s when i started my collection. each piece in the collection is given an unambiguous code mark which is put on the collector's name-label attached to each piece. each object is classified in one of a few categories by type of material which is denoted by a capital letter, for instance a for animal materials, ag for ancient glass, h for hardstones and all other minerals, w for wood and all other plant materials. the shape of the piece is denoted by a lower case letter, as with h for hollow-ware such as bowls, v for vases, s for statuary. the third element of the code number is the largest dimension of the piece in cm or, if smaller, in mm. pieces with the same code number are distinguished by capital letters, as in lots 38 (agv 13), 74 (agv 13a) and 30 (agv 13d). not to be incorporated in the code number are the following: structural features, alleged geographical, cultural or ethnic origin, alleged age, subdivision of any material category, eg. gold, lead, brass, bronze, copper are all m for metal, and earthenware, china, porcelain are all c for ceramics. to make the method effective, every object must have its card or computer equivalent, detailing a description, measurement and photograph, when, where, from whom and for how much it was bought, the insurance value updated every two or three years, presumed country of origin, region and date of production, and all exhibition details. the reason for attaching a label to each piece is that it establishes provenance and pedigree and, therefore, enhances the value of the piece. this is an informative, very useful and convenient system for identifying objects, not only for the collector, but for insurance schedules and for testamentary dispositions. in the following catalogue entries, each lot includes its plesch code mark. the property of mrs traudi plesch, o.b.e. and professor peter h. plesch lots 1-97 the following lot is sold not subject to return;

'bezeten bezit' (obsessed possession) in the historisch museum rotterdam in 1970. in the 1960s mrs elias-vaes acquired premises at the hoflaan 58-62 in rotterdam-kralingen. always eager to share the beauty of the objects with others and also to promote historical awareness, in 1990 she installed her collection in some 20 rooms at these premises and opened the 'kralings museum'. from then on many articles about her museum appeared in the media and the number of groups visiting the museum grew each year. following the death of mrs elias-vaes in 2002 it became clear that the kralings museum was in a delicate position. the endowment left to the museum was not sufficient to establish a professional museum organisation. assisted by a number of volunteers, the board of the museum tried to find ways of keeping the museum open. however, the revenues from visiting groups did not cover the bills and the increasingly rising level of the annual costs forced the board to decide to close the museum and sell the collection and premises. we trust that the passion and pleasure which mrs elias-vaes had in assembling this collection will be reflected in a series of exciting sales. at the same time, the sale catalogue is a tribute to her many efforts, recording what she achieved in her collecting life. it is our hope that all kinds of buyers, young and old, and at all price ranges, will be able to participate in the sales just as mrs elias-vaes did for so many years in the past. may the many objects from her collection find new homes and admirors throughout the world and in that way internationally represent the vision and passion of mrs elias-vaes. the proceeds of the sales will make it possible to establish a special fund which will support the study of art and art history for young people. this is very much in line with the intentions of mrs elias-vaes, who was convinced that part of a good education is the understanding of art and history and their complex interaction. through this fund, her legacy will be continued in a new way for many years to come. the board of het kralingsmuseum, stichting vaes-elias j.l. janssen van raay, chairman j.a. heuvelink, secretary g.m.b. toxopeus beep elias-vaes (1908-2002) rarely in recent years has a collection surfaced on the market of the scope and quantity of 'beep' elias-vaes. in all, the collection includes more than 4,000 objects, spanning some 3,000 years of international cultural development. to understand more about her passion and collection, a brief description of mrs elias-vaes's life seems appropriate. wilhelmina gerardina vaes was born into a wealthy rotterdam family in 1908. her father, johannes gerardus vaes (1871-1940), originally a broker in consumable oils, later became a director of unilever. in 1901, he married johanna geertruida van der veen. 'beep' and her elder brother nikolaus johannes ('bob') grew up in kralingen, the exclusive residential area of rotterdam. here, the family lived in the mansion 'het oude slot', slotlaan 29. the family also owned a house in the country, where they would often spend time in the summer. the vaes family made a number of journeys to other countries, including egypt. these travels aroused beep's keen interest in many different cultures and formed the basis for the variety and broad scope of her collection. in 1930 'beep' vaes married jonkheer adrien elias (1903-1963), a member of a dutch noble family that counted admiral michiel de ruyter and an amsterdam mayor amongst their ancestors. having no children, mrs elias-vaes focussed on collecting art and antiques following the death of her husband in 1963. initially she acquired objects related to admiral michiel de ruyter. gradually she extended her interest to a wider range of objects including paintings, books, furniture, sculpture, clocks, ceramics and glass, metal objects, silver, arms and armour, enamel and ivory. mrs elias-vaes developed her collection further with objects from very different regions and cultures such as egyptian, greek, etruscan and roman as well as chinese and japanese art. by the late 1960s, the collection had grown to such a size that it was regarded as worth exhibiting. in 1970, large parts of the collection were shown in a special exhibition in the rotterdam historical museum, appropriately entitled 'bezeten bezit' ('obsessed possession'), accompanied by an illustrated catalogue. in subsequent years, mrs elias-vaes organized bi-annual exhibitions of small specialized selections from her collection in the erasmus university in rotterdam. these included exhibitions of european pewter, early stoneware, early persian and egyptian art, various chinese artworks, european arms and armour, the history of the house of orange, and many other subjects. these exhibitions were curated to emphasize their educational aspect, which was important to mrs elias-vaes. during the 1970s and 1980s further purchasing enabled the collection to increase its depth and scope. early 1991, she opened the 'educational institute for cultural history het kralings museum' at hoflaan 58-62 in rotterdam, with the intention to educate those who visited her collection. the museum comprised no less than twenty individual rooms, each dedicated to a specific period, region or style, which mrs elias-vaes furnished accordingly with suitable objects from her collection, often specifically acquired for these rooms. a visit to the kralings museum would take one from classical antiquity to the beginning of the 20th century. the rooms connected different times and cultures, leading to an appreciation of their development and interaction. despite the fact that the premises of the kralings museum were originally intended as a retirement home, the museum was very much a combination of a private home and a professionally organized museum. many of the rooms were decorated with specially selected curtains, ordered from dols & co., amsterdam. over the years, mrs elias-vaes predominantly acquired works of art in the netherlands, both from auction houses and dealers, and sometimes from other private collectors. the auction houses included f. muller; p. brandt; mak van waay (later sotheby's); christie's, amsterdam; the notarishuis, rotterdam; mak, dordrecht; van stockum, the hague and van spengen, hilversum. the dealers from whom mrs elias-vaes acquired works of art included b. van leeuwen, the hague; ch. van der heyden, rotterdam; peters, tilburg; nijstad and lochem, the hague; beekhuizen, helmond; dirven, eindhoven; premsela & hamburger, amsterdam; j. schulman, amsterdam, besides many others. in 1999, mrs elias-vaes donated the collection and the premises to the stichting vaes-elias. by placing her maiden name first, she emphasized the fact that she was the force behind the collection. she also donated a number of pieces of arms and armour to the cavalerie museum in amersfoort. following the death of mrs elias-vaes in 2002, the board of the museum did much to reinforce the position of the kralings museum and the stichting vaes-elias in the netherlands. in 2006, a small number of pieces of arms and armour were sold at christie's in london. over time however, it became clear that the museum could not survive independently with the funds available. the board of the stichting vaes-elias carefully selected specific objects from the collection (partly from the vaes family collection) to be donated to institutions such as the municipal archives of rotterdam and amsterdam. the collection to be auctioned offers a unique chance for buyers to find something that interests them specifically, be it early egyptian, roman, 16th or even early 20th century. indeed, visitors at the viewing days run the risk of being distracted from their regular field of interest by the many categories represented in this sale, and might discover a fascination for an object in a new field. this may well result in an expansion of their knowledge and passion for a hitherto undiscovered personal interest just as mrs elias-vaes was lucky enough to experience for so many years. many lots carry estimates below 1,000 euros, which certainly offers new buyers or those with limited budgets an opportunity to acquire their own treasure from the almost infinite collection of mrs elias-vaes. tuesday 27 april 2010 morning session at 10.30 a.m. (lots 1-181a) the antiquities room (lots 1-119);

' maker to his majesty ': a vulliamy commission at harewood the pall mall firm of vulliamy & son, headed by the royal clockmaker benjamin vulliamy (1747-1811) with his eldest son, benjamin lewis (1780-1854) as junior partner, began expanding their interests in the first decade of the 19th century into the production of a wide range of decorative objects in ormolu, bronze and marble. the acquisition of such objets de luxe in ormolu and bronze, previously focused on french centres of excellence, gained a new momentum during the 1770s and 80s with the challenge from matthew boulton and the vulliamys to the dominance of french craftsmanship in this area of the decorative arts. these british makers continued to flourish into the 1800s since the traditional parisian suppliers of luxury goods had been largely cut off by the wars in france. these ornamental objects were usually designed by the vulliamys themselves in the latest empire or proto-regency taste, drawing on their extensive library of art and architecture. they closely supervised the making of each object by the network of independent specialists already employed to manufacture their ornamental clocks and using the finest techniques and materials. the majority of customers for such articles were the nobility, led by the prince of wales, thomas thynne, 2nd marquess of bath at woburn abbey and edward lascelles, 1st earl of harewood (1740-1820) with his eldest son, edward 'beau' lascelles, initially for their london home in hanover square and then for harewood in yorkshire. the following extract from the benson beevers manuscripts, compiled in the 1950s, details a bill dated 1810, the final year of benjamin vulliamy's life when his son was the dominant figure at 68 pall mall, revealing the breadth of commissions undertaken by the firm: ' vulliamy & son, watch and clockmakers to their majesties, the prince of wales, and the dukes of kent, cumberland and cambridge...ornamental plate and plate for table uses, designed in good taste, after antique models...large or small orders executed in silver or silver-gilt in the best manner...ornamental work in metal for lights or other purposes made and gilt in the best, or in common gilding ' a geoffrey de bellaigue describes in 'the vulliamys and france', the full range of their activities extended to the supply of " anything from a chimney piece to a door handle, from a piano to a button " to the right customer (d. vulliamy, the vulliamy clockmakers , london, 2002, p. 24.). an invoice book from the archive at harewood lists three entries for 'ornamental' commissions from the vulliamy firm in 1805 - two for the 1st earl of harewood and the other for his son beau: ' delivered a bronze tazza supported upon the backs of two eagles mounted upon a circular foot with blocks and lions masks the whole executed in bronze in the best manner & mounted upon black marble plinth at 12 guineas ' (27 june 1805, c104/58 no. 31 p.243) ' delivered two small bronze sphinxes with the fore legs extended designed from the antique fixed upon gilt plates at 10 gs. ' (31 december 1805, c104/58 no. 31 p.292) the tazza is almost certainly lot 2. with its stepped turned plinth and lion-headed paterae issuing eagle supports it relates to a similar vulliamy commission, conceived in ormolu rather than bronze, which was formerly at longleat and supplied to john russell, 6th duke of bedford (1766-1839). by 1813 the duke would appear to have given it to his sister-in-law, elizabeth, marchioness of bath (d. 1830), daughter of the 4th viscount torrington and wife of thomas, 2nd marquess of bath (1765-1837). the ormolu example was sold furniture, porcelain & silver from longleat, christie's london, 13-14 june 2002, lot 303 (£19,120). the two small bronze sphinxes (lot 1) are almost certainly one of two pairs of ' sphinx press papiers ' supplied ' for mr. lascelles '. those in the inventory are clearly the ones which remain in the collection at harewood collection. they are mounted on serpentine green marble plinths as distinct from the black marble examples offered here. the third entry describes lot 4 which was supplied to the 1st earl on an invoice dated 11 july 1805 at a cost of 18 guineas: ' large antique tazza with handles...black marbel [sic] plinth ' (c104/58 no. 31 p. 248).; christie's 05 december 2012 lot 501.

of savoy christie’s is honoured to offer for sale this eclectic royal collection. from 4th century b.c. daunian pottery, 17th century family portraits and rare manuscripts to chinese porcelain and post-war works by artists such as lichtenstein and pomodoro; the collection spans some twenty-four centuries of artistic achievement. this sale follows the highly successful sales from the collections of s.a.r. la principessa reale maria beatrice di savoia in 2005 and s.a.r. la principessa reale maria gabriella di savoia in 2007. this sale serves as the latest chapter in christie’s long held tradition of hosting royal collection sales, other royal sales have included the collections of h.r.h. the princess margaret and h.r.h. the prince henry, duke of gloucester in 2006, king george i of the hellenes in 2007 and h.r.h. the prince george, duke of kent in 2009. the 2005 and 2007 savoy sales comprised historic works of art from the collection of his majesty king umberto ii and queen marie josé of italy (and their ancestors) representing royal collecting on the grandest scale. one of the major highlights from those collections being queen maria-josé’s exquisite fabergé tiara, which realised in excess of £1,000,000. this collection demonstrates a continuance of the centuries old tradition of royal patronage and collecting seen in previous sales. the historic layered assemblage of centuries and generations past has been enriched here with the acquisition of bold twentieth century works of art demonstrating a visionary taste and flair for the moderne . the lake geneva residence, which housed this collection, was the perfect setting for such a diverse group. designed in the early 1970s with architecture characterized by bold, sinuous shapes and contrasting materials, great works of art were hung on the rough textured concrete walls of this bastion-like house with dramatic effect. built into the natural slope of the hill as it sweeps down towards the lake, the house is split over many levels around open plan living space with amphitheatre like integral couches encircling a gaudi-esque central fireplace which stands silhouetted against magnificent views of the jura mountains beyond. contemporary artworks were juxtaposed with ancient family treasures creating a uniquely dramatic mise en scene . the sale of this collection offers a unique glimpse of royal collecting in our own time. a short history of the house of savoy the royal house of savoy can be traced to umberto 'the whitehanded' (d. 1048) who acquired alpine territories as a feudal lord and became the first count of savoy. his sons and the dynasty that followed progressively acquired influence and land in piedmont, the territory east of savoy and south of the alps as well as ruling aosta, which borders switzerland and france. amedeo vi (d. 1383) called 'the green count' founded the order of the collar in 1362. known today as the order of the annunciation, it survives as one of the oldest dynastic orders of chivalry. in the late fourteenth century, amedeo's eight-year-old grandson succeeded as amedeo viii (d. 1451). though devout, he was a warrior-knight, whose faithful service to the empire earned him the title 'duke of savoy' in 1416. his descendant, emanuele filiberto (d. 1580) succeeded in 1553 and set about strengthening the house of savoy's position, both militarily and administratively, and in 1563 he moved the capital of savoy from chambéry to turin. the seventeenth century witnessed a great building program in turin. the future royal palace was completed in 1658, the carignano palace in 1680, and the madama palace, built in the thirteenth century, was expanded and refurbished. the holy shroud of christ, brought to turin in 1578, was venerated in a chapel of the duomo. vittorio amedeo ii, first king of sardinia (d. 1732), although wed to a niece of louis xiv of france and faithfully adherent to french foreign policy in the early years of his reign, was not averse to changing sides when political interests dictated. later in the seventeenth century he withdrew loyalty from france in order to support the spanish and austrian habsburgs. when the spanish refused to acquiesce to piedmont's takeover of milan, a separate treaty was written, weighed strongly in savoy's favour and against the interests of spain. at the opening of the war of the spanish succession, piedmont reunited with france. in the early eighteenth century vittorio amedeo ii aligned with the habsburgs and the english, and in 1713, the treaty of utrecht rewarded him with new lands in north-east italy and a crown in sicily. seven years later vittorio amedeo ii accepted, in exchange for sicily, sardinia, a realm that he could more easily rule from turin. during the french revolution and the napoleonic wars, sardinia became a refuge for the house of savoy. in 1831 the succession passed to a branch of the family descended from tommaso francesco, prince of carignano. carlo alberto, (d. 1849) succeeded carlo felice, king of sardinia (d.1831), his fifth cousin one generation removed, to become king of sardinia and duke of savoy and he in turn was succeeded in 1849 by his son vittorio emanuele ii (d. 1878). vittorio emanuele ii, king of sardinia and later first king of italy from 1861, assisted by d'azeglio, cavour, crispi and garibaldi, acquired for the house of savoy, sardinia's sister states and by 1870, with the acquisition of the papal state, the union was nearly complete. the risorgimento was a complex and controversial movement, but its result, a united italy, was long overdue. vittorio emanuele ii's eldest son umberto i succeeded in 1878. he married a savoy cousin margherita (d. 1926), and moved the savoy court to the quirinale palace in rome and lavishly re-furnished the villa reale monza, milan. during the nineteenth century the royal residences included the quirinale palace, moncalieri, racconigi and villa reale monza. the villa was emptied of most of its furnishings in 1859, many of which were transferred to the palazzo reale of milan for the visit of napoleon iii. from that date, monza was occupied by umberto i, the 'principe di piemonte'. after his accession in 1878, furniture was purchased in large quantities for the state and private rooms until 1900, when the king was assassinated. from then on, monza rapidly declined and was virtually unused. in 1919, king vittorio emanuele iii (1869-1947) took the decision to transfer ownership of most of the royal residences to the italian state. later the private property of the royal house of savoy, racconigi was gifted with its contents by king vittorio emmanuele iii (d.1947) to his son umberto (d.1983), prince of piedmont (later king umberto ii), following his marriage to princess maria-josé of belgium in 1930. the pieces that appear in this catalogue are all privately owned. the family residence of racconigi was acqiured by the italian state in the 1970s, carefully conserved and later opened as a state museum in 1980. born at racconigi, umberto was a competent officer, well groomed to succeed upon his father's abdication. this he did in 1946, reigning briefly as umberto ii. in a war-torn nation, umberto and his wife, the adamantly anti-fascist maria-josé, campaigned to preserve the monarchy. in june 1946, a popular referendum decided narrowly in favour of a republic and umberto and marie-josé left for portugal. 'il re di maggio', as umberto was christened by the italian press, died in geneva in 1983 and maria-josé in 2001. they are both buried in the abbey of haute combe on the shore of lake bourget, savoy; the ancestral burial ground of the savoy family.; christie's 15 october 2019 lot 1.

brinsley, later sir brinsley, ford (1908-1999).; property of a trust giovanni domenico tiepolo three drawings from the punchinello series (lots 56-58) building on the formidable legacy of his father giovanni battista, one of the great painters of the 18th century, domenico tiepolo developed a successful career of his own, excelling at painting as well as at etching and drawing. as the prime assistant to his father, he worked on large decorative schemes, including those in würzburg and spain, and reproduced his father’s works in prints. while doing so he also developed his own voice, which grew only stronger after giovanni battista died in 1770. to the grand repertoire of the latter’s religious, mythological and allegorical compositions, domenico added lighter, wittier, more fanciful notes, some religious or mythological in inspiration, but others taken from everyday life and popular culture. many of these themes, which are now associated with the tiepolo name as much as those treated by the father, were explored by domenico in pen and wash rather than in oil, and often in series, which seem almost intended to prove the draughtsman’s inexhaustible powers of invention. it is arguably in three ambitious series of similar size produced near the end of his life that domenico’s personality shines through most brightly: the ‘new testament’ series, which he started working on around 1785 and which numbers over three hundred sheets; the ‘scenes from contemporary life’, some of which are dated 1791, based on domenico’s observation of everyday life in venice and the terraferma ; and what can be called his swansong, the 104 drawings preceded by a title page that make up a series titled ‘divertimento per li regazzi’ ( entertainment for children ), also known as the punchinello series. full of quotations from works by himself, his father and earlier artists, the three series were clearly made as independent works of art, and indeed many of the sheets are signed. they treat their subjects in appropriately distinct ways, but are fully coherent in their style, richly elaborated in different shades of brown wash barely contained by the fluid penwork, over an often quite summary chalk underdrawing, and displaying brilliant use of the white paper to create highlights. nearly all illustrate a predilection for compositions inhabited by figures placed close to the foreground, and they demonstrate – even in many of the biblical scenes – the artist’s quick wit, his gift as a storyteller, and his taste for the anecdotal. they are dazzling displays of a kaleidoscopic emotional range and an almost unparalleled stylistic and narrative exuberance. in contrast to the biblical source of the ‘new testament’ series, the punchinello series is not inspired by any known literary text, but rather from the main characters of the improvised popular theatre of neapolitan origin, the commedia dell’arte. domenico chose a more good-natured interpretation of the originally malicious and boorish pulcinella, to use his common italian name, one of the main characters in the commedia . ‘for all we know,’ wrote james byam shaw, ‘domenico may have invented a tale himself as he proceeded, after the ingenious fashion of the modern strip-cartoonist’ ( the drawings of domenico tiepolo , london, 1962, p. 54). while on occasion giovanni battista tiepolo had already depicted punchinello in drawings from the 1730s, the character appealed even more strongly to domenico, who included him in paintings such as the metropolitan museum’s country dance as early as ca. 1755 (see fig. 1). it was several decades later, though, in the 1790s, that domenico chose punchinello to represent his joyful vision of life more fully. in the frescoes (now at the ca’ rezzonico, venice) decorating his villa at zianigo on the mainland, domenico painted punchinello’s boisterous activities on a large scale. and during these final years of the artist’s career, when the 18th century came to a close and the venetian republic was conquered by napoleon’s troops, domenico also turned to punchinello and his extended family for his last and perhaps greatest of his series of drawings. ‘it is the culture of that vanished world that domenico, with nostalgia and humor, mythologized and immortalized in the divertimento ’ (l. wolk simon, domenico tiepolo. drawings, prints, and paintings in the metropolitan museum of art , new york, 1996, p. 67). several publications from the last decades, especially adelheid gealt’s domenico tiepolo. the punchinello drawings (new york, 1986), which reproduces all sheets, have led to a better understanding of the story and significance of the series. but while gealt believes the order is basically loose, allowing for several storylines, george knox has argued that the numbers at upper left outside the framing lines on the sheets, almost certainly in the hand of domenico himself but unfortunately not fully documented, must indicate the proper way of reading the life of punchinello (‘domenico tiepolo’s punchinello drawings: satire, or labor of love?’, in satire in the 18th century , new york and london, 1983, pp. 125-131, 144-145). the series starts with the ancestry and childhood of punchinello (fig. 2, no. 1 of the series). in the first of the drawings offered here, we can see punchinello learning to walk (lot 56). later, in his youth or adolescence, he is briefly arrested and imprisoned, after which the story recounts his wandering years. his busy life as a mature man comprises of ‘various trades and occupations’, including a stint at a barber’s shop (lot 57). the mood of the scenes is not invariably festive or amusing: on occasion domenico strikes a darker tone, as in the burial scene also offered here (lot 58). at the conclusion of the series we even witness punchinello’s own end, as well as his own burial (fig. 3, the penultimate scene). nicknamed the ‘last masterpiece of venetian art’ by pierre rosenberg (in the french edition of gealt’s book, p. 9), the ‘divertimento per li regazzi’ was rediscovered as an unbound series at a sotheby’s sale in london on 6-7 july 1920, lot 41, described as ‘one hundred and two carnival scenes, with many figures’. (apart from these 102 sheets, the lot also included the title page. two drawings were separated from the group at an earlier stage, one of them now lost, the other at the morgan library and museum). bought by the london firm of colnaghi, the drawings were subsequently acquired by a british dealer based in paris, richard owen, who exhibited the series in full in 1921 at the musée des arts décoratifs in that city. soon afterwards began their slow and steady dispersal, with many ending up in public collections in the united states, primarily in the robert lehman collection at the metropolitan museum of art and in the cleveland museum of art, each of which have nine. like the group of six drawings sold on 3 december 2019 in these rooms, the three drawings offered here were once part of a larger group of fourteen, acquired in 1936 and 1937 by brinsley ford (1908-1999) (gealt, op. cit. , nos. 2, 6, 8, 16, 17, 20, 22, 27, 43, 48, 49, 51, 58, 70, ill.; see b. ford, ‘the ford collection’, walpole society , lx, ii, 1998, p. 99). describing himself as ‘merely an aesthete’, ford – as a trustee of the national gallery (1954-1961), a contributor and director (1952-1980) of the burlington magazine , and a long-standing member and later the chairman (1974-1980) of the art fund – contributed greatly to these and many other endeavours in the british art world in the second half of the previous century (see f. russell in oxford dictionary of national biography , online version, consulted 10 june 2020). he was knighted in 1984. ford inherited part of his family’s distinguished art collection, particularly rich in works of the 18th century welsh landscapist richard wilson, but also made numerous major acquisitions himself, including the fourteen drawings by domenico tiepolo. although only a sample of the rich biography which domenico painted of his hero, the three drawings offered here give an idea of the fullness of punchinello’s life, with an emphasis on the brighter days. ‘the unobtrusive satire, the topical anecdote, and the fantastic liveliness of the whole work make a place for domenico all of his own, out of the shadow of his great father, in the history of comic drawing’ (j. byam shaw, ‘some venetian draughtsmen of the eighteenth century’, old master drawings , vii, no. 28, march 1933, p. 58). but, as gealt remarked, ‘the divertimento amuses, but it also enlightens; as such, it remains an incomparable legacy. nearing his own death, domenico taught us about life, through humor, understanding, compassion and hope’ ( op. cit ., p. 21). punchinello may be at moments the object of our ridicule, but domenico also made his pleasures and fears, his adventures and misfortunes, relatable and recognizable. like falstaff, he provides us with both a laughing stock and a mirror, and like that hero at the end of verdi’s opera (also the final word of an aged and wizened artist), domenico seems to tell us that ‘tutto nel mondo è burla’ – ‘everything in the world’s a jest’. fig. 1. giovanni domenico tiepolo, a dance in the country , oil on canvas. the metropolitan museum of art, new york. fig. 2. giovanni domenico tiepolo, the birth of punchinello's father. private collection, sold at christie's, london, 3 december 2019, lot 42. fig. 3. giovanni domenico tiepolo, the burial of punchinello . the metropolitan museum of art, new york.; christie's 29 july 2020 lot 56.

A set of four gilt- composition two-branch wall-lights, id n 07bd8b00c00f8806d1f7ebe11bbd58d044dbecb45e655348ffdba23111e4f87256d90052d880a405336dd5609cd5deb52e51304dafc29e6357c25c8232f36857, has this provenance: the countess of avon: a tribute by hugo vickers this sale represents a remarkable and yet living time capsule. it is rare that the collection of a man born in 1897 comes to the market 125 years later, having remained in the same private hands all those years. and yet until last year, the pictures and furniture were very much part of a life – they furnished the london apartment of the countess of avon. it was here, where she entertained an eclectic group of friends until very recently. she died last november at the great age of 101. due to her longevity, it is only now that the distinguished collection of the earl and countess of avon is presented for sale. it affords the rare opportunity to buy works of art and furniture that belonged to anthony eden, not only one of the most distinguished politicians of the 20 th century, foreign secretary and prime minister, but a man of high artistic and aesthetic discrimination, and of his highly intelligent and intellectual wife, the former clarissa churchill, who possessed exquisite taste, without question the most developed taste of any prime minister’s wife in the 20 th century. over the years, these pictures and works of art sat firstly at number 10 downing street, and later at fyfield manor, wiltshire between 1958 and 1966, where they were illustrated by country life in 1961, the manor house aldvediston and then settling, in the 1980s, in clarissa avon’s london flat on bryanston square. it was here, in clarissa avon’s drawing room with its fabulous apple green walls that became the later backdrop to this collection of art. at oxford, the study of painting had been anthony eden’s passion and all consuming interest. with fellow oxonians lord david cecil, chips channon and robert gathorne-hardy, he had founded the uffizi society. he wrote a paper on cézanne, which was hailed as one of the most brilliant papers ever written by an oxford undergraduate. in forming his collection of art, he started young, buying a constable in munich in 1921 for £200, and later works by degas, braque and picasso. denys sutton hailed him in apollo as ‘an amateur of the arts who if circumstances had been different might have been a painter.’ segonzac was an appreciative admirer (see lot 36 for segonzac’s portrait of lord avon). sometimes paintings were gifts. in august 1958 eden thanked winston churchill, his predecessor in downing street, for one of his paintings: ‘the picture has arrived & we are both delighted with it. it is hung in the drawing-room & looks very well, all in its shimmering green.’ eden’s love of art was matched by clarissa’s. they did not always agree about friends, but they did share taste in art. she was a friend of the welsh painter and wood engraver, david jones. she was sketched by jean hugo (the great-grandson of victor hugo) and painted in later life by lucian freud. she was photographed by her lifelong friend, cecil beaton and by horst. the dining room at bryanston square was also the library. she transferred eden’s books from his library at alvediston. i photographed all the books in that library so that she should recreate it perfectly, with the books in the right order. (further volumes from lord avon's library will be sold at bellmans, sussex in december). while at christ church, eden had impressed as an aesthete and a linguist, fluent in arabic, turkish and with a considerable knowledge of persian literature. no visit to paris was complete without a visit to the second hand bookstalls on the south bank of the seine. for relaxation at oxford, he read balzac, flaubert, stendhal and zola and he collected and devoured the more serious french literature and philosophy, and relished the work of the russian novelists. his library represented what his biographer called ‘a comprehensive survey of french culture’ and furthermore contained many rare persian books, some of them given to him by the last shah of iran. furthermore he was a sophisticated judge of furniture and ceramics. clarissa will be remembered differently by many whose paths she crossed. some found her distant and disapproving – she could be (rather enjoyably so, i always thought), and others no doubt found her somewhat authoritarian (such as the youthful steward, john prescott, aboard the ship that took them to new zealand in 1957). perhaps raymond carr was apt when describing her in 2007 that ‘in her prime the stare of her intense blue eyes and the sting of her sharp tongue would drive self serving politicians and their pushy wives to take refuge in silence’. but to those whom she admitted into her world, she is remembered for her sparkling intelligence, her exquisite taste, her unique sometimes impish sense of humour, her love and knowledge of literature, music and the arts, her extraordinary garbo-esque beauty, and also for her quality of unswerving loyalty as a friend. there were three parts to her life – her early haute bohemian youth – her marriage to anthony – and then the long years on her own as a widow. born in 1920, she had led a bohemian life in her early days. she used to say that it was surprising she had good aesthetic taste, since her family’s home in the first years of her life was in cromwell road, overlooking the natural history museum, but fortunately the victoria and albert museum was not far away and that she explored eagerly. she was remote as a child. she once said that cecil beaton had to escape from his family background and find his own world, and to some extent that is true of her too. she declared that she never spoke unless she had something pertinent to say and so she very often remained silent. she was never destined for a conventional life. the social world held little allure and she eschewed the traditional aristocratic rural pursuits. she loved to read – and she read voraciously and very fast (i once saw her devour a novel in an afternoon). besides art, she loved music – especially opera. in later life she often went to covent garden with her friend, lord goodman. as the bodies piled up on the stage at the end of the performance, lord goodman was inclined to comment: ‘nothing a good lawyer could not have sorted out!’ clarissa soon found her way into an interesting intellectual set, being taught philosophy by freddy ayer, and studying with lord david cecil at oxford. here the gifts of being exceptionally beautiful, intelligent and well connected stood her in good stead. her world was enriched by her friendships with james pope-hennessy, evelyn waugh, lord berners at faringdon and others. later she undertook a variety of jobs, including working for the film producer alexander korda, and the energetic publisher george weidenfeld. when in 1952 at the age of 32, she married the then foreign secretary anthony eden, her world was suddenly peopled with de gaulle, eisenhower, khrushchev and bulganin. an enjoyable feature of reading her letters from those years was to find distinguished politicians of that era being dismissed as buffoons, and she was no fan of harold macmillan, believing that he played a significant role in the fall of her husband, at which point, of course, he took over as prime minister. she came into anthony eden’s life at a difficult time. her uncle winston churchill played a cat and mouse game, one minute about to retire, then staying on, then about to go, and finally lingering until 1955. ‘he resigned for the tenth and last time’, she said. at number ten, she and anthony hardly ever dined alone, and even in the private apartments, secretaries were forever rushing in. she used to have her friends in for drinks, but then realised that the last thing anthony wanted to find was a group of them in the drawing room at the end of a long political day. a notable exception was when cecil beaton brought garbo to see her. at that point, he deserted his office and bounded up to meet the star. eden’s landslide general election victory in 1955 hinted at some years longer in number ten, but the suez crisis brought that to an end. she described that phase as a nightmare, but a living one, and said in later years that her joke about the suez canal flowing through her drawing room haunted her till the end. after suez, when eden stepped down in 1957, clarissa devoted herself to caring for him – and never was that loyalty more fully engaged. she looked after him beautifully, surrendering her own interests to that cause, and it was by all accounts a very happy marriage. they travelled widely and enjoyed winters on becquie and later in barbados. though retired from politics, they were still closely involved, visited by politicians in the uk and abroad, with figures such as sir robert menzies and vincent massey coming to call, and in 1975 mrs thatcher arrived for lunch at alvediston by helicopter. it was only after eden died that she resumed her london life, the opera and theatre and her more bohemian friends. she even took to deep sea diving and, while on the ocean bed, would swim with her air bottle strapped to her back and carrying a stick. in those later years, she was fiercely protective of anthony’s memory. dissatisfied with one biography, she commissioned d.r. thorpe to write another. during those years she made copious investigations into eden’s health and state of mind during the suez crisis in order that he be fairly assessed in these biographies. she was confident in her opinions, and i found that more often than not she was right. she was unique in that if a biographer consulted her about say, evelyn waugh, she would take it for granted that he knew she knew him and then assess him in the third person. she did not do what most sources do and talk about herself. living in wiltshire as she did for so many years had, what might be called, the hazard of cecil beaton as a neighbour. clarissa and lady anne tree suffered somewhat from the misconception that they got ideas for their houses and gardens from him, that he influenced their taste. invariably it was the other way round. i asked them both if they would in any way reorganise or tidy the house in the knowledge aware that cecil was coming for a visit and that his all-encompassing eye would be taking everything in. ‘reluctantly yes,’ was the answer. he was inclined to pass judgement on any improvements: ‘oh ten out of ten, clarissa!’ i loved clarissa’s acerbic take on life. i told her that in australia james fairfax, a friend we had in common, had sent a car to collect me from canberra, to bring me for lunch to his country home, retford park, in bowral, and then take me on to sydney, a drive of 180 miles. did she say: ‘how kind of him?’ not a bit. her comment was: ‘he must have been desperate for company.’ and when she expressed her wish to leave a dinner party in patmos in 1983, she expressed this as: ‘i think we’ve exhausted the social possibilities of this evening, don’t you?’ she had a quality of positive negativity. this sale represents a very particular and considered taste. it is one of the most special collections to come to auction for many years. the great statesman - anthony eden: a career by ollie randall anthony eden was probably the greatest british diplomat of the twentieth century. he served three remarkable stints at the foreign office between 1931 and 1955, with an unparalleled range of achievements and experiences that included five years in churchill’s war cabinet. there followed an unhappy twenty months as prime minister, best remembered for the suez crisis, but his career was much more multifaceted and laden with success than is often remembered. born in 1897, anthony eden was the fourth of five children born to sir william and lady eden née sybil grey. anthony was aware of a persistent rumour that he was in fact the son of george wyndham, a close friend of his mother’s whom he resembled, but the dates do not appear to match up. sir william eden was a colourful, fiery eccentric known as “the bloody baronet.” his temper and impetuosity were legendary, and his hobbies were painting and violent boxing matches with acquaintances. lady sybil was a charming, hard-partying spendthrift, whose ability to burn through money became a regular headache to her children in later years. from this mixture anthony inherited his father’s volatility and aesthetic taste, and his mother’s glamour and good looks. his parents’ overbearing natures seem to have left anthony with a lasting melancholy that was only tempered later in life by his marriage to clarissa. as a teenage volunteer in the first world war, he earned a military cross as a captain of the king’s royal rifle corps, but two of his three brothers were killed in action. after the war, he studied persian and arabic at christ church, oxford. in 1923 he married his first wife, beatrice, and a month later he was elected to parliament as the member for warwick and leamington. his marriage to beatrice was not a success, though they had two sons, simon and nicholas. in 1925 he began his government career by becoming the pps (parliamentary private secretary) to the under-secretary to the home office; he then embarked on a world tour, which he wrote about in a 1926 book, places in the sun. from july 1926 until the conservative defeat in may 1929, eden was the pps of the foreign secretary, austen chamberlain: this was an unrivalled opportunity for the oriental studies graduate to get to know the foreign office. in august 1931, a grave financial and political crisis led to the creation of a national government under labour prime minister ramsay macdonald. eden became the new under-secretary at the foreign office, taking up the job on 1 september 1931. eden appointed, as his unofficial pps, viscount cranborne, later 5th marquess of salisbury, who became his closest adviser and greatest political ally, buttressing all of eden’s decisions. soon they were catapulted from the national to the global stage. in 1933, eden took over as britain’s lead delegate at the world disarmament conference, an unsuccessful attempt by the league of nations to impose legal limits on the military capabilities of each country. his bold attempts to resolve the deadlock made him an international celebrity, but were scuppered by the newly-elected nazis. nonetheless, the experience had proved to eden that a combination of pragmatism and vision could yield real results for britain in the role of honest broker in international affairs. already internationally famous as a dashing young politician and a great hope for peace, eden was promoted to lord privy seal in january 1934. in this role he undertook two remarkable journeys across europe in search of a basis for new peace agreements. these trips took him and cranborne to berlin, rome and moscow, for a unique series of meetings and dinners with hitler, mussolini and stalin. following the assassination of king alexander of yugoslavia in 1934 by a terrorist trained in hungary, eden averted a near-inevitable war by personally brokering a settlement between the yugoslav and hungarian governments. in the same month, he pioneered the world’s first international peacekeeping force to oversee the saar plebiscite in early 1935. in december 1935, the foreign secretary was sacked for his mishandling of mussolini’s invasion of abyssinia. eden became the new foreign secretary, at the age of thirty-eight. much earlier than most of his colleagues, eden saw that it was naïve to expect goodwill and fair dealings with hitler and mussolini. he believed in re-arming to strengthen the british bargaining position, while never giving way to the dictators’ threats or pleas except in exchange for tangible british gains. under eden’s robust leadership, a pan-european non-intervention committee was set up to prevent the spanish civil war from developing into a continental conflict; this committee was a masterpiece of carrot-and-stick diplomacy to keep the dictators in check. when it became apparent, for example, that the italian navy was most likely responsible for a spate of submarine attacks on mediterranean civilian vessels, eden did not confront the italians for fear that they might quit the non-intervention committee. instead he and cranborne devised a scheme of patrol zones to ward off “spanish” submarines, even roping in the italians to patrol a zone of their own. the outmanoeuvred submarines disappeared. however, eden found himself increasingly undermined by neville chamberlain, who took over as prime minister in may 1937. chamberlain deliberately ambushed his foreign secretary with public proclamations and private newspaper briefings that forced eden to modify his policies. he opened a clandestine back-channel with the italian embassy via secret agents; and he told his sister-in-law in rome to give mussolini assurances that eden had not agreed to. all this made eden’s position increasingly untenable. in january 1938, president roosevelt privately approached the british government with an offer of cooperation – something for which eden had been working strenuously for years. but eden was on holiday that week, and chamberlain poured cold water on roosevelt’s proposal without informing eden. a month later, the last straw was chamberlain’s insistence that formal negotiations must be opened immediately with mussolini, despite the fact that mussolini had flagrantly violated eden’s preconditions for such a step. on 20 th february, eden and cranborne resigned. at this juncture, eden was the national emblem of hope and peace. it was not at all clear whether the government could survive his departure. but he was not a political killer, and he faded into the background rather than lead a revolt against chamberlain. when the second world war began a year and a half later, eden and churchill were brought back into the government: ostensibly a unifying move, in practice this silenced chamberlain’s two most potent critics. eden was dominions secretary until churchill became prime minister in may 1940 and appointed eden secretary of state for war. and in december of that year, eden was promoted to his former position as foreign secretary, entering the inner sanctum of churchill’s war cabinet. the war cabinet, never consisting of more than eight members, was the nerve centre of the british war effort. as churchill centralised as much of the running of the war as he could, the war cabinet’s role was pivotal, and enabled eden to play a leading part in strategic decision-making. sometimes exasperated by the difficulties of working with churchill, eden nevertheless formed a very close partnership with his chief. at the same time, eden had to keep up the diplomatic work of the foreign office, meeting with stalin and roosevelt amid ongoing efforts to coordinate the allies’ objectives. in 1942, churchill wrote to the king to formally nominate eden his successor should he be killed or incapacitated. as eden was the most senior tory in the war cabinet after churchill, and the conservatives were the largest party in the wartime coalition, eden was the obvious choice; but nonetheless this official recognition of his status as heir was to hang over him for the next thirteen years. later in 1942, he was given the additional role of leader of the house of commons, which he held for the remaining duration of the war. in 1945, eden was a leader of the british delegation to san francisco for the conference that set up the united nations; he returned early to england for the general election, to receive the news that his son simon had been killed in south-east asia. this bitter blow led to his divorce from beatrice, from whom he had been drifting apart for years. following the conservatives’ election defeat, eden was one of the frontrunners to become the un’s first secretary general. instead he became the day-to-day leader of the opposition in the house of commons, with the ageing churchill happy to take a hands-off role. it was unclear when eden would become the formal head of the party, though many expected it to be soon, and in 1947 came the first of several attempts by senior conservatives to advise churchill to stand aside in eden’s favour. these attempts to install eden continued through churchill’s final term of office, from 1951 until 1955, but eden himself played no part in them. if he had lacked the killer instinct to move against chamberlain, he certainly wasn’t going to depose churchill, his war comrade and – from 1952 – his uncle by marriage as well. his marriage to clarissa churchill, through producing no children, brought him fulfilment and happiness that his first marriage had not. eden’s third stint at the foreign office (1951-5) was marked by astonishing diplomatic success. he played a key role in solving several of the world’s trickiest international disputes: the control of trieste, the independence of austria, the management of iranian oil, and the future of indo-china – the latter of which had threatened to turn into a war between china and the usa. eden also played a key role in brokering closer integration between continental european countries, single-handedly pushing through his own proposal for a western european union. however, a botched gall-bladder operation in 1953 left him near death, and his old ally bobbety cranborne (now the 5 th marquess of salisbury) became acting foreign secretary until he could recover. in 1955, the cabinet finally compelled churchill to honour the last of a string of promises to eden about his transfer of leadership, and eden became prime minister on 6 th april 1955. the night before, churchill told a confidant, “i don’t believe anthony can do it;” whether this was prophecy or bitterness is impossible to judge. despite having been tipped for the top job for the past twenty years, eden had never made the slightest effort to obtain the office that he now inherited. he immediately called a general election, and the incumbent government increased its majority for the first time in nearly a century. but after this high point, the subsequent twelve months were hard going. eden’s reshuffles seemed half-hearted – once again, he lacked ruthlessness. his government appeared to lack direction, and the shine was taken off his public image by a ferocious press campaign against him (largely driven by personal vendettas against the edens by pamela berry, whose husband ran the daily telegraph , and winston churchill’s son randolph). on 26 july 1956, eden held a crisis meeting of his inner circle to discuss his precarious position. a few hours later, the president of egypt, colonel nasser, nationalised the suez canal. the canal had been under british and french ownership, and british oil supplies depended on it. at stake were british prestige and economic independence, and the seizure of the canal set off four months of crisis within eden’s government. eden, salisbury and the suez subcommittee of the cabinet were convinced that nasser could not, at any cost, be allowed to win. for eden, nasser was another mussolini, whose rapaciousness must be met with vigorous opposition rather than appeasement. an international conference came up with a compromise arrangement, which nasser rejected when the usa made clear that they would not enforce the deal. in increasing desperation, eden secretly colluded with the french and israelis to create an artificial military crisis which would give anglo-french forces an excuse to seize the canal. when this plan went ahead at the end of october, there was international outrage. eden had been led to believe that the americans would stay neutral, and he had also convinced himself that the labour party would support him to preserve national unity. instead, the americans lined up against them at the un and facilitated a run on the pound, while labour ferociously attacked the government in the house of commons. under pressure from every side, eden aborted the military operation midway through, before the full length of the canal could be seized. eden’s fragile health broke down under the strain; even a much needed holiday to jamaica was not enough for him to recover, and on 9 th january 1957 he resigned. it was widely rumoured that he was driven out by a political coup; although this was not the case, he may well not have lasted much longer in any event. eden’s health continued to trouble him for the rest of his life, and the edens spent every subsequent winter in the caribbean. he continued to believe that his actions over suez had been both right and largely successful, and he was horrified by his successor macmillan’s abandonment of the suez “gains.” in 1961 he was elevated to the house of lords as the earl of avon. his retirement was largely spent writing four volumes of memoirs, whilst pursuing his lifelong interests in art, the islamic world and literature. living quietly in retirement with clarissa, he was still viewed as “the great statesman” and always enjoyed visits from contemporary politicians. he died aged seventy-nine in 1977, the last surviving member of the war cabinet. of the many tributes offered in both houses of parliament on his death, perhaps out of all the most potent is the most personal: his former pps, lord carr of hadley, commenting “nobody who knew him well could ever be with him for long without feeling that life was indeed worth living”. ollie randall is
