If you are summoned at any time to act there in order to cultivate the fields, in order to flood the riverbank, to transport sand (from) west (to) east or vice versa;  here I am , you shall say.Egyptologist Flinders Petrie (1853-1942) working on a dig in Hawara, near the Faiyum in 1888 discovered the tomb of Horudja, priest of the goddess Neith and son of Seshet. The tomb was flooded and in disarray, but yielded many important objects.  The finds are now spread across many of the world's museums and private collections.\n",

Over 700 helmets are depicted in large full color photo-realistic illustrations.Ancient Greek helmets are emblematic of the culture that created them at a time when entire nations were often obliterated by more powerful adversaries.  Yet, the Greeks survived and thrived.  Their armor was the product of a culture that respected free thought, innovation, foreign trade, and scientific inquiry unhindered by religious dogma. In their elegant and effective designs, we see the accumulation of these unique factors:  individuality, industry, pursuit of excellence, and the desire to protect the lives and property of men that cherished these values.',\n",

Its principal quarry was located at Chemtou in Tunisia, ancient Numidia, hence its Latin name marmor numidicum.  By the Augustan period, it had become synonymous with luxury and wealth, frequently appearing in public monuments and private residences throughout the empire. It was very often used in herms - rustic statues representing Hermes or Dionysos.   Dionysos (Latin: Bacchus or Liber) was the god of wine.  Consequently he was seen as the personification of the life force of the vine and vegetation and the earth\\'s fertiltiy.  He was a volatile god whose rites were celebrated in an ecstatic and orgiastic fashion.  His female devotees were the Maenads (Bacchantes) and their drunken and lascivious male counterparts were the Satyrs (Fauns).  Drunken old Silenos was also a member of his retinue.  No where in ancient literature is the passion and fury of Dionysos better articulated than in Euripides tragedy, \"The Bacchantes,\"  (ca. 406 BC).  Where Dionysos and the women of Thebes exact a terrible revenge on young prince Pentheus for his failure to pay homage to the god.',\n",

Its principal quarry was located at Chemtou in Tunisia, ancient Numidia, hence its Latin name marmor numidicum.  By the Augustan period, it had become synonymous with luxury and wealth, frequently appearing in public monuments and private residences throughout the empire. It was very often used in herms - rustic statues representing Hermes or Dionysos.   Dionysos (Latin: Bacchus or Liber) was the god of wine.  Consequently he was seen as the personification of the life force of the vine and vegetation and the earth\\'s fertiltiy.  He was a volatile god whose rites were celebrated in an ecstatic and orgiastic fashion.  His female devotees were the Maenads (Bacchantes) and their drunken and lascivious male counterparts were the Satyrs (Fauns).  Drunken old Silenos was also a member of his retinue.  No where in ancient literature is the passion and fury of Dionysos better articulated than in Euripides tragedy, \"The Bacchantes,\"  (ca. 406 BC).  Where Dionysos and the women of Thebes exact a terrible revenge on young prince Pentheus for his failure to pay homage to the god.',\n",
